She looked eager, leaning in close and listening intently, her practical look contrasting with the political charm he'd seen in photographs. They ordered modestly, barely touching their food, more engrossed in their conversation than in the cuisine. At one point, the chef saw her pass him a small, discreetly wrapped package. As they left, the politician looked around, his eyes lingering on the four patrons still scattered around the dimly lit dining area, as if cataloging, evaluating their potential for gossip. The chef pretended to focus on his work, but the strain in the politician's movements lingered in his mind, an unspoken story simmering beneath the surface of an otherwise ordinary night.",
        "postedit": "The politician entered my restaurant with a woman who seemed oddly familiar. It was almost closing time, and I was tidying up. They took a corner booth, and when I got a better look at her, I recognized the woman: she was his aide. I'd seen her on the sidelines while he gave speeches, walking at his side while he was interviewed by reporters outside the Senate. She was young and eager—qualities I rarely see in the political elite who come to my restaurant. They didn't order much and hardly touched their food. Instead, they mostly just talked. At one point, I saw her pass him a small, discreetly wrapped package. When they left, the politician scanned the room, but I pretended not to notice.",

        "Human-Written": "Last summer (so the chef reports), a politician from the state drove through. The woman with him couldn't have been his wife. They sat right there, next to the window with a sideways view down to the port. He ordered local produce for her (\"I always dine from the region,\" he said. \"That's how you end up with the simplest and the freshest food.\" The cheapest, too). They'd have the brandied aubergines to start with, oily, cold, lascivious—and then the pork stew and a bottle of the earthy hillside wine that no one from the region drinks. You can imagine what he had in mind for her—what with the alcohol, the aphrodisiacs, his hand pushed out across the tabletop to stroke her painted fingernails, the showing off.",

On the pavement, Bernhardt erected his tripod and his tilted umbrella, and I prepared myself to enter the usual trance of inanition—forgetting that in this part of Eurasia, at least for now, there was no longer any small talk.

Ray and Donny Ross, grinning mischievously, approached, jostling each other with playful roughness. Kit felt uneasy because of his past with Ray, while Ann, oblivious, was charmed by Ray’s easy jokes, leaving Kit wondering if he had ever stood a chance. Meanwhile, Donny, the quieter twin, eyed Kit with a look that was almost interrogative, as if attempting to decode Kit's every move. As Ann unpacked sandwiches and lemonade, she caught sight of Charlie, the park's caretaker with rough hands and gentle eyes. Charlie nodded at her as they shared a silent recognition that needed no words. Ann's heart fluttered wildly, her usual lighthearted banter with Ray unable to mask the sudden surge of confusion.

And that thin metal rod had been pulled out of the wall so often by clumsy guests that it barely supported the weight of the towels.

Then she sprayed minty soap into the sink and the shower, did a quick wipe with her hand towel, and ran hot water to wash the soap down the drain. She sprayed the toilet bowl, flushed, and repeated the process. She didn’t have to scrub at any stains because of the departed guest’s good manners.

Lime's citrusy bite cuts through the sweetness of watermelon, while jalapeño introduces a subtle heat that lingers. Cilantro adds an earthy freshness. This combination transforms the original. The result is a familiar dish with a surprising twist. It's a culinary journey that transports you to a sun-drenched patio in Mexico City, even as you sit in your own backyard. The salad becomes more than a side dish; it's a conversation starter, a cultural bridge. Like a cold beer on a sweltering afternoon, it refreshes immediately while encouraging you to savor the moment. It's a refreshing and delightful dish."

No one would have described her as shy back then, and when she went to the beach with her cousin Molly the first afternoon and saw a group of boys sweating over a little black ball on the paddleball court she went right up to them, not five feet away, and watched as they leaped and grimaced and slammed at the ball with all the raw frustrated adolescent power boiling up out of them, until they began to falter, to hit out, to lose the rhythm of the game—and it was no secret why. It was because she was there, with her pretty, dark features, which everyone said were just like Rita Hayworth’s, with her nails freshly done and a white towel slung insouciantly over one shoulder, dressed in the swimsuit she’d spent the better part of an hour admiring in the full-length mirror at Genung’s before she said yes and counted out the money at the cash register. There were four boys playing and half a dozen others sprawled on the grass at the edge of the court, but the one who caught her eye—the tall one, with slicked-back dirty-blond hair, shrinking T-shirt, and black high-top basketball shoes that he wore without socks—was Sid.",

The thought of studying tide pools and documenting sea life filled her with a quiet excitement she hadn't felt in years. She imagined herself knee-deep in salty water, carefully observing the intricate dance of hermit crabs and the gentle sway of sea anemones, her notebook filled with detailed sketches and observations. Sarah ran her fingers through her newly cut hair, shorter now than it had ever been. She thought about the shelves of self-help books she'd accumulated over the years. She smiled at the thought of her new life. It wouldn't be easy, starting over at 42, but the prospect of rediscovering herself and pursuing her passion for marine life energized her in a way she hadn't felt since her college days. As a breeze touched her face, Sarah took a deep breath, savoring the fresh night air. She was ready for whatever came next.",

He'd wear the same navy windbreaker, even in warmer weather, and the creases in his khakis spoke volumes about his lack of attention to details most would consider important. His routine was precise: order a black coffee, pull out a weathered notebook, and begin scribbling intermittently, pausing only to tap his pen against the mug or glance out the window, eyes distant and melancholy.

On the second loop, she slowed down as she approached, and jogged in place for a little while. Her face was blotchy with exertion, but she wasn’t sweating very much. This made her seem pretty—full of restraint. She had taken her headphones off when she got close, and I could hear a pop song leaking out of them.",

I listened for his step and thought at some length about what he would say or do, and how I’d respond. When he didn’t come, not once, I cursed the effortless happiness of married people.",

One afternoon, Menon struck up a conversation, leading Brandon into deep discussions that peeled away his presumptions. Menon’s insights juxtaposed hard realities against Brandon’s naive idealism. As layers of ignorance shed, Brandon saw himself mirrored in the marginalized voices he studied—misunderstood, underestimated.

Then, Brandon remembered the harsh overhead lights of the library and Menon's essays on geopolitics, their trade-cloth cover already stained by so many hands before Brandon had found them. Morning after morning, Brandon ran through the park, breathing in the mist; as he passed Krishna Menon, his mind turned to Egypt, the state of the world, and the haze thickened. One afternoon, Menon saw him and stood. \"I saw you the other day, in the library,\" Krishna Menon began. Brandon opened his mouth but couldn't think of what to say.

His ignorance seemed to widen with everything he read. He turned in the end to a cheap history of the world published during the war. This he could hardly understand.

Willie thought he was swimming in ignorance, had lived without a knowledge of time.

After endlessly watching the news about the Egyptian crisis, Brandon felt a strong desire to understand it beyond the sound bites. He started haunting libraries, consuming history books, articles, and even Menon's essays on geopolitics. Despite his efforts, he remained confused. One afternoon, Menon struck up a conversation, leading Brandon into deep discussions that peeled away his presumptions. Menon’s insights challenged Brandon’s naive views. Shedding layers of ignorance, Brandon saw himself reflected in the overlooked and underestimated stories he studied. The self-reflection was revealing, making him aware of his own privilege. By the end of his journey, Brandon didn’t have all the answers, but he learned the value of humility and the profound importance of listening.",

The absence of clear information was itself a shroud, each missing word a knife twisting deeper into her doubts.

Nadia had been estranged from her family since she had completed university and announced, to their anger and fear and dismay, that she would henceforth live on her own. She passed their house one afternoon on purpose, not to speak with them, just to see from the outside if they were there and well, but the home she had forsaken looked deserted, with no sign of inhabitants or life. When she visited again, it was gone, unrecognizable, the building crushed by the force of a bomb that weighed as much as a compact automobile. Nadia would never be able to determine what had become of her family, but she always hoped that they had found a way to depart unharmed, abandoning the city to the predations of warriors on both sides, who seemed content to flatten it in order to possess it.",

A young server, oblivious to the guest's identity, placed a tray of lukewarm meatloaf and overcooked vegetables before him. Frost nodded in thanks, his eyes scanning the room with a mixture of amusement and nostalgia. Gradually, whispers began to ripple through the hall as students pieced together who had joined them for dinner. A brave English major approached, clutching a dog-eared poetry anthology, but hesitated a few steps away. Frost caught her eye and offered a gentle smile, which seemed to both invite and gently discourage interruption. As he ate, the poet observed the ebb and flow of conversation around him, occasionally jotting down a phrase or two in a small notebook he'd pulled from his pocket. When he finished his meal, Frost stood up, leaving behind a neatly folded napkin and a few lines of verse scrawled on his empty tray.

When he appeared in the dining hall, slowly crossing from the side door with the headmaster, gingerly mounting the two steps to the high table, the ordinary din of the hall died almost to silence. We kept eating and tried not to stare, but we couldn’t help ourselves. Frost let himself down into the chair at the headmaster’s right, facing out toward the hall. He bent his big white head as he arranged his napkin, taking his time. He seemed deeply absorbed in the problem of the napkin. Then Dean Makepeace rose at the head of his table, turned toward Robert Frost, and began to clap in a measured, decorous way, each report of his hands sharp as a shot, and the rest of us jumped to our feet in a great scrape of chairs and made the hall thunderous with applause and the rhythmic drumming of our feet on the oaken floor. Frost gave a little bow with his head, but we kept the racket up, and finally his reserve broke and he smiled boyishly and rose partway in his chair and waved his napkin at us like a flag of surrender.",

The classroom noise receded as Bragonzi traced the faded initials carved into the wood.

Bragonzi hesitated for a moment, but when he took the box, its rough texture felt reassuring against his fingertips. Once back at his desk, he lifted the lid to find a set of worn but meticulously maintained charcoal pencils. The classroom noise receded as Bragonzi traced the faded initials carved into the wood. His father's voice, low and gravelly, broke the silence: \"I thought you might find better use for them than I did.\" Bragonzi nodded.",

        "Human-Written": "It rained the following days, and the schoolyard remained deserted. That Sunday, their Instructress told Bragonzi that there was a surprise in store for him, his dad had come from Milan to see him, he was to run and get dressed, chop-chop! His dad took him to a restaurant and then to the movies to see a Lemmy Caution film, after which they strolled around the port looking at the ships. Toward evening they got in a taxi, but instead of giving the school’s address his father said, “To the train station.” Bragonzi didn’t ask any questions, and he kept silent even in the baggage room, where his father reclaimed a big black bag. They returned to the school in another taxi, and only when they were in front of the gate, with the taxi-driver waiting to head back to the station, did his father crouch down and open it. The first thing to emerge was an issue of Soldino, but already Bragonzi had started to tremble; then came a stick of modelling clay and a little puzzle, and meanwhile the rustling of cellophane could be heard underneath; then there was a balsa-wood model-airplane kit; and then, finally, that transparent bag, which his father gave to him after making him wait longer than for the other presents, as he smiled back in silence and hoped that his tremors weren’t visible. “Thank you,” he said, and he wanted to add something else, but while he was thinking about what this should be his dad had already got back in the taxi. And so Bragonzi hid everything under his raincoat and ran to the dormitory. It was past the hour when boys needed to come back from any outings “already fed,” for the rules barred these temporary escapees from joining the others in the refectory during meals (his father didn’t know this, since Bragonzi had never been brave enough to tell him), and so there was no one around. After putting the other presents in his closet, Bragonzi sat on the bed with the see-through bag on his knees. It was closed with a thin red drawstring and, in addition to the ball, contained the pump and the needle for inflating it, as well as a little box of wax and a small felt cloth with zigzag edges for polishing: once opened, the bag released a delightful leathery aroma, which reminded Bragonzi of the smell of his nicest pair of shoes. The pump was icy cold, the ball less so. He stuck the needle into its valve and began to inflate it with care: some of the air in this room, he thought, is going to end up inside there, and it will never come out again. When every last pentagon had popped out convexly, he removed the needle. He spread his thighs slightly apart to better hold the ball, not wanting it to touch the floor. It was magnificent, a Derbystar “Deliciae Platearum,” even more beautiful than Best’s “World Cup” ball; he couldn’t imagine how hard his father must have had to look before finding it, or how much he had paid for it, its white just slightly pearlier than the rest, with iridescent reflections, and black pentagons framed by a subtle red outline, and a little yellow star right underneath its brand name, a ball even Rivera would kick cautiously, truly like nothing he had ever seen before . . . He fondled it awhile with his fingertips and slid it against his cheeks to take in its smoothness, decided to give it a few more pumps, then went back to caressing it. He looked at the clock: before long, the other boys would all be coming back upstairs, he had to be quick. He put the pump and the bag in the closet, and went down to the atrium with the “Deliciae Platearum” under his arm. From there, he passed through the television lounge before skirting the refectory, crouching down beneath the windows so as not to be spotted by the diners; at the end of the hallway, the door to the schoolyard was open—the Instructresses liked to take a stroll right after dinnertime.",

They had shared a place with two other housemates in Boston when they were in law school, and for as long as they had been friends they had been talking about visiting China together. It was one of those promises made for not keeping, similar to the solo trip to Antarctica that Bella had sometimes imagined when things were going wrong in her marriages. But China, not as far-fetched as Antarctica, had become much closer when Peter started dating Adrian, a French-Canadian whose great-grandfather had been among the Chinese laborers who collected bodies and dug graves on the Western Front in 1918. Adrian was a writer, and he was working on “a multigenerational and intercontinental epic” based on his family history, and during the past two weeks the three of them had toured a number of towns on the East China Sea, sifting through local archives, tracing the untraceable. We know his surname was Li, Adrian had said of his great-grandfather, and that his family migrated from Jiangsu to Shandong sometime during the Qing dynasty. Do you know how many people bearing that surname live in China? Bella had said. Ninety million.",

He felt a knot in his stomach, his parents' decision weighing heavily on him. \"Nikhil,\" they had said. Gogol said nothing, but he could feel a lump forming in his throat. It was completely strange to him—a name that didn’t quite fit. He looked out the window, watching buildings blur into one another, his sense of identity being rewritten against his will. Gogol was what he had always been. The name held memories and whispers. Now, with this new name, he felt like he was living someone else’s life. The fear gnawed at him—how would his friends react? Would they even recognize him anymore? He clenched his small fists, trying to hold onto his identity, trying to remember who he was. His parents, though well-intentioned, seemed utterly oblivious to the emotional turmoil that churned within him, focused on a future that to him seemed uncertain and distant.",

        "preedit": "Caperton felt an unfamiliar stillness in the house after his mother died and his father retired. The hum of daily routine had been silenced, replaced by the hesitant shuffle of his father’s slippers across the hardwood floors. The kitchen, once alive with his mother's presence, now held an emptiness that gnawed at him. There was no one to fill the void with humming or the smell of baking bread. His father's retirement meant they were both home, but existing in separate orbits. Caperton's grief was a quiet thing, a reluctance to touch her belongings that still felt saturated with her essence. Sometimes, he caught his father staring out the window, his eyes flickering as if seeing ghosts. They spoke little, their conversations now driven by need rather than want, and always stopping short of what weighed most on their hearts. Nights were the hardest; the nights stretched endless and raw, revealing the depths of their solitude. Caperton felt an urge to leave, to escape the oppressive weight of absence, but also a guilt that kept him rooted. It was in the small gestures—an extra cup of coffee made for an unspoken partner, a blanket folded just so on the couch—that their love and grief intertwined, holding them both captive in a house that was both sanctuary and prison.",
        "postedit": "The house was dead now, Caperton thought. His mother had died a few months ago, and his father retired shortly after. Now that his father no longer had a routine to give his life meaning, he reminded Caperton of a ghost. The shuffle of his slippers against the hardwood floors became ominous, as though the feet were disembodied. The kitchen seemed particularly empty to Caperton in his mother's absence. When she was alive, she'd fill the room with the sound of her humming or the smell of her baking bread. His father's decision to retire was ostensibly made, at least in part, out of mourning. But Caperton soon realized that his father's grief would be private; his own was a quiet thing, manifesting in a reluctance to touch his mother's belongings, which seemed to be the house itself. He sometimes caught his father staring out the window, but they spoke little, and only out of necessity. Nights were the hardest. Caperton felt an urge to leave, to escape—but he found himself rooted by guilt. Caperton knew that his father needed him, and perhaps Caperton needed him, too.",

He meant well, but to a grown Caperton these designs were rather Cabrini-Green-ish, huge and institutional, as though Larry meant to warehouse the local jays and sparrows in balsa-wood towers of utter marginalization. It troubled Caperton to the point that he considered talking to his father about it, but then construction halted. Crises of the body beckoned. Lung inflammations, nano-strokes, mystery cysts, myeloma scares. Caperton raced home for it all. But Larry couldn’t deliver, until, apparently, now.",

Thomas asks for some more details about the film, which she provides, and he decides that, yes, he would like to see this film, so Thomas and Mary go to the cinema and watch the film, which is called “We Need to Talk About Kevin,” and both of them enjoy it, up to a point, and afterward they go to a bar and have a drink and talk for quite a long time about the film and about their children and their relationship with their children, since the film is largely about parents and the terrible mistakes you can make with your children, and both of them feel how pleasant it has been to chat together and what a good decision it was to come out together and see a film.",
