Yet, Anaís had grown fond of the eclectic community in London Terrace, where she'd found solace in the rhythms of the African drumming circle that practiced in the courtyard. As Rafa's visits became more frequent, Anaís began to open up about her life, and he listened with a quiet empathy that put her at ease.

However, this very authenticity is also what makes Portland vulnerable to the pressures of tourism. As the city's popularity grows, so do concerns about gentrification, rising housing costs, and the potential erosion of its unique character. Visitors must be mindful of their impact, respecting the city's scale and pace, and seeking out experiences that support local businesses and communities. Despite these challenges, Portland remains a refreshingly unpretentious destination, where the pleasures are simple, the people are genuine, and the sense of community is palpable.

And then there is the food. Maine's largest city has long been nationally known as a top food destination, and just this year two Portland bakers won James Beard Awards. To host travelers, culinary or otherwise, five boutique hotels have opened since 2020. The hotel construction, new high-end condo development and rising coastal real estate prices have exacerbated a housing crisis here.

Judith and the children were busy with the provisions; Ramón went up to the observatory to prepare the photographic plate for the night. In the morning, he struggled to free himself from the children, who overwhelmed him with lighthearted questions: How far was the lake? Would it still be frozen? Had he remembered the rubber raft? He went into the darkroom to develop the plate; he dried it and placed it beside the plate that he had made seven days earlier. He examined both under the microscope: good, they were identical; he could leave in tranquillity. But then he had a scruple and looked more carefully, and realized that there was something new—not a big thing, a barely perceptible spot, but it wasn’t there on the old plate. When something like this shows up, ninety-nine times out of a hundred it’s a speck of dust (one can’t be too clean in the workplace) or a microscopic defect in the emulsion; but there is also the minuscule probability that it’s a nova, and one has to make a report, subject to confirmation. Farewell, outing: he would have to retake the photograph on the following two nights. What would he tell Judith and the children? ♦",

Marina, his young caregiver, couldn't help but notice the way his eyes, once bright and inquisitive, now seemed to hold a deep sadness, like a reservoir of untold stories. His wrinkled skin, etched with the lines of time, seemed to whisper tales of love, loss, and hardship. The way he clutched his cane, a lifeline to a bygone era, spoke of a desperate need for control in a world that was rapidly slipping away. Marina sensed that his physical appearance was not just a reflection of his age, but a testament to the weight of his experiences. The way he spoke, in hushed tones, as if sharing secrets, hinted at a life lived with purpose and passion.

He’d had to give up driving because of his glaucoma; anyway, he had no friends to visit in this country, apart from his daughter.

So we cling to what's left, no matter how tenuous, because it's what we know. We tell ourselves that with just a little more effort, a little more love, a little more compromise, we can revive the thing that once brought us joy. But deep down, we know it's a lost cause, a dying plant we're watering out of habit rather than hope. Still, we persist, driven by a mix of guilt, fear, and loyalty. We don't want to be the one to let go, to be the one who gives up. It's a twisted sense of responsibility, as if we're duty-bound to see this thing through to its bitter end. And so we stay, even when every fiber of our being is screaming to leave, to move on, to find something new. Until, finally, the weight of our own exhaustion, our own heartache, becomes too much to bear.

Alex, it turned out, had a side hustle as a magician's assistant. We bonded over our shared fascination with the art of illusion, and before I knew it, I was helping him with his shows on weekends. At first, it was just a fun distraction from our 9-to-5 jobs, but as the months went by, I found myself looking forward to those nights more and more. There was something about the thrill of deception, the precision of misdirection, that resonated with me. As Alex's skills improved, so did his ambition, and soon we were performing at larger venues, even landing a few TV spots. I became an integral part of the show, not just as a behind-the-scenes helper, but as a participant, donning a disguise and playing the role of a bewildered spectator. The magician, a charismatic figure named Max, took me under his wing, teaching me the intricacies of his craft. Over time, our little trio formed a tight-knit family, bound by our love of magic and our desire to astonish.

The summer sun beat down upon their shoulders. Their parents, beaming with excitement, welcomed them with open arms, the initial awkwardness of reunion dissipating as they settled into the comforting routine of home. Munna, the more outgoing of the two, regaled their family with tales of pranks and mischief, like the time they convinced their cousin that the village well was haunted by a mischievous spirit while Chottu listened intently, his eyes sparkling with amusement. They fell into a rhythm of lazy mornings, spent lounging in the courtyard, and afternoons exploring the surrounding fields, rediscovering the hidden streams and secret glades of their childhood, where they had spent countless hours exploring and dreaming together. Yet, amidst the warmth and comfort, subtle tensions simmered beneath the surface. Munna's stories of school began to reveal a hint of bravado to prove himself while Chottu's quiet reserve masked a deep-seated anxiety about the future. Old rivalries and alliances began to resurface as they struggled to reconcile their diverging paths with the unbreakable ties of their childhood, and the memories of their shared past began to feel like a double-edged sword, both a source of comfort and a reminder of the distance growing between them. The summer air pulsed with the promise of adventure, but also the uncertainty of growing up as they grappled with the realization that their lives were slowly drifting apart, like the branches of the ancient banyan tree that stood sentinel over their village."

Bob Dylan, the young upstart, had wandered in, looking for inspiration or maybe just a good time. As Dylan approached, Mingus raised an eyebrow, his gaze piercing through the smoke-filled air. \"What brings you to my neck of the woods, kid?\" he asked, his deep voice skeptical. Dylan launched into a rambling explanation of his latest songwriting endeavors, but Mingus's attention began to wane. The woman appeared, a blonde with a smile that seemed to be trying too hard. Without breaking eye contact with Dylan, he murmured, \"Excuse me, sweetheart, I'm in the middle of a conversation.\" The woman's smile faltered and she drifted away. Dylan caught a flicker of disdain in Mingus's eyes. Mingus had no patience for frivolous distractions. As the night wore on, Dylan found himself drawn into Mingus's orbit, mesmerized by the older man's intensity and unwavering dedication to his craft."

What really killed her was how difficult it was to communicate with Sasha when they were apart. Sasha couldn’t call Olga, because of her husband, but Olga called him often. Usually, they were assisted by Andrei, Sasha’s alcoholic roommate, a blind but not fully deaf man, who would hand-sign with Sasha and then translate to Olga. But he could convey only certain information, not the feelings! He was filthy-minded and rude, and he was often drunk! He made fun of Olga when she asked him to translate how much she missed and loved Sasha, and he never said that Sasha missed her, too. Olga wasn’t sure if Andrei was choosing not to translate that part, or if Sasha didn’t say that he loved her because Andrei’s presence made him shy. At the end of a phone call, Olga would ask Andrei to pass the phone to Sasha so that she could listen to his breathing. Sometimes Olga would sing to him. Sasha said that, even though he couldn’t hear her, he could feel the vibrations. Olga knew a lot of weepy ballads, and she would sing them as loudly as she could. This was often more eloquent than Andrei’s dumb translations. If only the phone connection were better. There were times when the call was disconnected mid-song. Olga would find herself all alone, hundreds of miles from Sasha, sitting on the low wooden stool in the dark hall of her apartment with that greasy old receiver beeping at her like an angry siren, making her want to die.",

The first customers trickled in, their curiosity piqued by the buzz surrounding the restaurant's delayed opening. The kitchen sprang to life. Waiters hovered around tables, refilling water glasses with an air of nervousness. Chef Emma was struggling to keep up with the orders. Orders were called out, pots clanged, and the stoves roared to life, but Chef Emma was struggling to find her rhythm. Maria's business partner, Jack, stood by the till, watching the money roll in. The restaurant found its stride. The staff relaxed into their roles, the kitchen's tempo quickened, and the diners, initially hesitant, began to relax, their laughter and chatter mingling with the clinking of glasses. Maria's eyes kept drifting to the empty table by the window, the one reserved for Alex."

She eats less now than she used to, but she hasn’t got used to grocery shopping with that in mind. She watches the women who roam the aisles gripping baskets barely weighted with a single chicken breast, two oranges, a child-sized carton of milk meant for lunchboxes. Walking advertisements for precarity. Who wants to die alone in her apartment and be left undiscovered for enough time that the smell of soured milk would be the giveaway? And here was another piece of advice her daughters had ignored: Always wear a good pair of underwear and a matching bra. Which was the opposite kind of warning, she realizes, aimed not at longevity but at the possibility of dying suddenly and violently and being discovered with your skirt up around your ears in a pair of sad panties.",

I was wet through and I’d begun to shiver, so I turned the engine over and got the heater going. The mud was still flowing, I could see that much, and the white dog had disappeared, along with the couple from the U-Haul. Apparently they’d found shelter somewhere, in the little gas station-cum-grocery store that was La Conchita’s sole commercial establishment, or in one of the cars stalled behind me. There were people out on the pavement, hunched-over forms wading through the mud and shouting at one another, and I thought I heard the distant keening of a siren—police, fire, ambulance—and wondered how they expected to get through. You might find it hard to believe, but I really didn’t think much about the danger, though if another section of the hillside had let go we’d all have been buried, no doubt about that—no, I was more concerned about the package in the trunk. Why hadn’t they called me back? What were they waiting for? I could have been slogging down the road already, the cooler propped up on one shoulder, and somebody—I thought of an ambulance from the hospital—could have met me a couple miles up the freeway. But no, the ambulances would all be busy with the wreckage in front of me, with people trapped in their cars, bleeding from head wounds, their own organs ruptured, bones broken. Or in those houses. I turned my head to look out the passenger’s-side window at the ghost of La Conchita, at the rectangular grid of split-level homes and trailers up against the hillside which had been there ten minutes ago and were gone now. Just then, just as I turned, a streaming dark figure surged up against the car and a woman’s face appeared at the window. “Open up!” she demanded. “Open up!”",
