Leaving the shop, Sarah hoped her regular cleaner's renovations would take longer than expected. She immediately chided herself for the thought. She walked home, her mind drifting to memories of shared laughter and whispered promises, all sparked by a simple errand she’d rather have avoided."

Keep an eye on the drip and his heart rate, and wake me if anything seems irregular. I said, All right. She lay down on her seat, using her arm as a pillow, and dropped off straightaway, her head and feet pointing in the same direction as my father’s. Four o’clock came and she slept on, but I didn’t wake her, because my father’s vitals showed no sign of changing; they weren’t plummeting as she’d predicted. I didn’t feel tired at all, though my ass hurt from sitting still for so long and I had to wiggle it around. Then all of a sudden I needed to pee; the urge came out of nowhere, like someone pulling a sink plug. I said to the driver in a low voice, Hey, I need to pee, is there a rest area coming up? He didn’t answer and kept facing the road. I didn’t think I could hold it much longer, so I scuttled to the front and said, Sir, sorry to bother you, but I need to use the bathroom. Still, he said nothing, as if he found my request so ridiculous that merely replying would wound his dignity. I tapped his shoulder and said, Sir, I’m about to piss myself, could you stop? That was when I looked in the rearview mirror and saw that his eyes were shut. Startled, I thought, Wait, I must be mistaken—does he just have small eyes? I leaned forward and, no, he was fast asleep, breathing evenly, in through the nose and out through the mouth, even snoring lightly, every muscle in his face relaxed, a faint sheen of grease shining in the street lights, his hands still on the wheel. There was a slight bend in the road up ahead, and without hesitation he guided the vehicle around it, stepping on the accelerator and the clutch as needed. I grabbed his shoulder and shook him, but he didn’t wake up. Next I pinched the back of his neck, but again, nothing. He just jolted as if a needle had pierced his bum, rising a little from his seat before settling back down. We were going about ninety miles per hour, and I couldn’t stir him.",

When he appeared in the dining hall, slowly crossing from the side door with the headmaster, gingerly mounting the two steps to the high table, the ordinary din of the hall died almost to silence. We kept eating and tried not to stare, but we couldn’t help ourselves. Frost let himself down into the chair at the headmaster’s right, facing out toward the hall. He bent his big white head as he arranged his napkin, taking his time. He seemed deeply absorbed in the problem of the napkin. Then Dean Makepeace rose at the head of his table, turned toward Robert Frost, and began to clap in a measured, decorous way, each report of his hands sharp as a shot, and the rest of us jumped to our feet in a great scrape of chairs and made the hall thunderous with applause and the rhythmic drumming of our feet on the oaken floor. Frost gave a little bow with his head, but we kept the racket up, and finally his reserve broke and he smiled boyishly and rose partway in his chair and waved his napkin at us like a flag of surrender.",

A food processor makes easy work of the all-butter pie shell, which can be chilled, then baked, a day in advance. Unlike with traditional crème brûlée, there’s no need to simmer the cream on a stovetop or use a blow torch, ramekins or water bath to pull this dessert together. The filling is simply blended together, baked in the pie shell, then chilled. Broil the pie just before serving to achieve that characteristic crackle on top; like a typical crème brûlée, the filling will be delicate, loose and delightfully wobbly.",

To get to the bus stop, we had to cross a field, which by November was covered in snow that the sheared brown stalks sworded through. We were always late. I was always the only one who’d eaten. Someone’s hair was always wet, the ends frozen. We huddled in the enclosure, inhaling secondhand smoke from Soraya’s cigarette. The bus took us past the Armenian church to the orange tram. Then it was a long ride to the school, on the other side of the city. Because of our different schedules we rode back alone. Only on the first day, at Mrs. Elderfield’s insistence, did Marie and I meet up to travel together, but we took the tram in the wrong direction and ended up in France. After that I learned the way, and usually I broke up the journey by dropping in at the tobacco shop next to the tram stop, where before catching the bus I bought myself some candy from the open containers that, according to my mother, were crawling with strangers’ germs.",

The other kids chattered and laughed, their voices a cacophony of excitement about the upcoming school dance and weekend plans, but I remained silent, lost in thought about my parents' recent argument and the growing pile of unpaid bills on our kitchen table. We passed by Mr. Johnson's farm, where a lone scarecrow stood sentinel in the frosty field, its tattered coat flapping in the wind.\n\nSuddenly, the bus jerked to a stop, the brakes screeching and the engine sputtering in protest. A fallen tree blocked our path, its branches heavy with snow. The driver muttered under his breath as he radioed for help. Time crawled as we waited. Some of the older boys volunteered to help clear the road, their boots crunching in the fresh powder. Their breaths were visible in the frigid air. A sense of camaraderie grew as we all pitched in, passing branches down the line.\n\nWhen we finally arrived at school, nearly an hour late, our cheeks were rosy and our spirits high. As I hung up my coat, I felt a strange sense of accomplishment, as if we'd all shared in something special."

The main thing is to avoid having to deal with anybody, which turns out to be easier than she thought it would be. After a couple of days she’s kind of stir-crazy. When she isn’t slogging through “A Tale of Two Cities,” she keeps her earbuds in and texts with Lexie, or sometimes with Evan, who’s this boy from school. She’s hung out with Evan a few times, and once, at a party, in an upstairs bathroom, let him get to second base. Under the shirt but over the bra. But lately this girl, Jenna, who goes to private school, is all over his Instagram. Not like in pictures with him, just hearting every single post and sometimes leaving “first!” as a comment, which for Jenna’s own sake Charity hopes is irony, but who can say. Lexie thinks Evan is a loser, which yeah maybe, but he’s funny and easy to be around, so if he texts her she usually texts him back, sometimes right away and sometimes after waiting some random amount of time. And sometimes, like right now, she texts him first. “My grams is losing it. All she does is clean the same clean shit. She’s like bleaching bleach.”",

But as the weeks stretched into months, she found herself caught between the comforting familiarity of childhood visits and the suffocating reality of her current situation. The low ceiling and musty air, once nostalgic, now felt confining as she grappled with early adulthood. Her days were split between online job hunting and helping her grandmother around the house. The routine, oddly enough, gave her a sense of purpose. As weeks turned into months, her initially supportive friends began to drift away. Their occasional visits became stilted, filled with awkward silences and forced small talk. They talked about their advancing lives, while Charity felt stuck in limbo. \n\nLate-night talks with her grandmother revealed unknown family history. She often found herself watching neighbors through the basement's small window. As time passed, Charity grappled with feelings of inadequacy and fear of the future, but also discovered a resilience she didn't know she possessed. The challenge of living in such close quarters with her grandmother taught her patience and empathy, skills she hadn't realized she needed to develop. Despite the difficulties, Charity began to see this period as a chrysalis, sensing that when she finally emerged, she would be changed in ways she couldn't yet understand."

That plus the fact that other regulatory legislation had recently made it legal for the state’s prisons to run call centers, staffed by inmates, and for various reasons the prison call centers only had to pay the inmates/workers ninety-five cents an hour. . . .",

The brother, Alonzo, ate alone, paid his bill, then went over to Caesar and smiled. “It’s good to see you,” he said. Caesar simply nodded and walked away with the tub of dirty dishes. The brother stood shaking for a few moments, then turned and made his unsteady way out the door. He was a corporate attorney, making nine times what his father, at fifty-seven, was making, and he came back for many days. On the eighth day, he went to Caesar, who was busing in a far corner of the restaurant. It was now early September and Caesar had been out of prison for three months and five days. “I will keep coming until you speak to me,” the brother said. Caesar looked at him for a long time. The lunch hours were ending, so the manager would have no reason to shout at him. Only two days before, he had seen Yvonne in the hall for the second time. It had been afternoon and the dead light bulb in the hall had been replaced since the first time he had passed her. He recognized her, but everything in her eyes and body told him that she did not know him. That would never change. And, because he knew who she was, he nodded to his brother and within minutes they were out the door and around the corner to the alley. Caesar lit a cigarette right away. The brother’s gray suit had cost $1,865.98. Caesar’s apron was filthy. It was his seventh cigarette of the afternoon. When it wasn’t in his mouth, the cigarette was at his side, and as he raised it up and down to his mouth, inhaled, and flicked ashes, his hand never shook.",

When Alonzo walked in, Caesar's chest tightened. His brother's appearance was a stark reminder of the family he'd left behind when he'd gone to prison. His brother looked older, grayer, with deep lines etched around his eyes, but his swagger remained unchanged—the same cocky gait that had gotten him into trouble so many times before. They embraced awkwardly, Caesar's starched chef's coat crinkling against Alonzo's worn leather jacket, the weight of unspoken words hanging between them. As they sat in a corner booth, Caesar noticed Alonzo's fidgeting hands, a nervous habit from childhood that Caesar thought he'd outgrown. They chatted about the weather, avoiding any mention of the past three years. Caesar studied his brother's face, looking for any hint of judgment or disappointment. Alonzo's gaze kept shifting to the other patrons, as if expecting someone to recognize him from his mugshot on the evening news. Alonzo took a bite of his food and nodded approvingly. Caesar felt a small sense of relief.\n\nAs the visit wore on, the tension dissipated. They laughed at an old inside joke, and for a moment, it felt like old times—before Caesar's stint in prison and Alonzo's struggles with addiction. But when Alonzo rose to his feet, the reality of their situation settled back in. They hugged again, this time with less hesitation. Watching his brother walk away, Caesar was both relieved and saddened, knowing their relationship would never be the same."

I named him Speedy, a joke that made my parents laugh. For weeks, I diligently cared for Speedy, talking to him as I cleaned his tank and offered him lettuce leaves. One morning, I found the tank empty. My mother explained that Speedy had \"gone to live in a pond,\" her voice gentle but firm. I nodded, accepting her words, but a part of me knew something was off.

Her new colleague, a young man with a perpetually bored expression, barely looked up from his monitor as the creature entered. The creature awkwardly shuffled to an empty desk, its movements accompanied by a soft, tinkling sound, like wind chimes in a gentle breeze. As it settled into its chair, Lyra couldn't help but stare, her curiosity piqued by the creature's unusual appearance. She tried to focus on her work, but her mind kept wandering to the creature. She had so many questions. The air grew heavy with an uncomfortable silence, broken only by the hum of the computers and the occasional rustling of papers. Lyra risked another glance at the creature, only to find its luminous eyes already fixed on her, a look of quiet understanding passing between them. Lyra realized that they were all in the same boat, trying to get through another day at work."

By the second day, Kiara could recognize a pattern: those with newer, brand-name shoes seemed to hold power over the social scene, equipping them with an unspoken entitlement.

The pink perigee moon was visible through the windows, floating beside us like a loyal owl. But Starling was by this point a little freaked out. I could understand that, of course. She didn’t want to give me her headlamp, and so reluctantly I let her take the lead. “Look, Dad,” she called, fixing her low beam on two heavy doors. “Seems like something you’d be into.” The doors were bracketed by a beautiful W.P.A. marquetry mural, with two human figures cast as guardians of the portal. A young barefoot girl stood under the tree of life with a dove on one arm, and I swear she looked just like Starling. The wood grain turned an undersea green and mauve as she spun her light over the doors’ engraving: “Send Us Forth to Be Builders of a Better World.”",

Instead of the expected deer or fox, a silent owl swooped low, startling us both. We pushed through to a glade where the Northern Lights unexpectedly danced overhead. Amazed, we almost missed the hidden trailhead at the edge of the clearing.\n\nWhen we finally reached the observatory, it was nearly two in the morning. Inside, the air was thick with decay. While searching, Dan tripped over a decayed floorboard, revealing a sub-basement. Climbing down, we stumbled upon more than just an artistic mural: an intricate tableau of stars and figures painted with an ethereal glow. Dan traced the constellations with his fingers and shared stories of his father’s bedtime tales about star maps and journeys. It added an unexpected depth to our discovery.

However, when the white family attempts to enter the valley, it reveals itself to be a spatial anomaly—a strip of ground between two fences which is too small to enter. Or, more strangely, when outsiders, such as the white family, insist on entering it, it shrinks and flattens them to fit. Lafferty’s story, originally published in 1966, still has much to recommend it: a delightful insouciance; admirable ethics (even if expressed in twentieth-century terms); surrealist humor; a winking self-awareness that affiliates it with more labored forms of literary metafiction yet lacks the overt self-consciousness with which the present story is hobbled. The present story now acknowledges that by basing itself on a specific earlier science-fiction story it is also indebted, paradoxically, to another: “The Nine Billion Names of God,” by Carter Scholz, which was based on “The Nine Billion Names of God,” by Arthur C. Clarke, and which has amused and obsessed the writer of the present story for decades. The story now acknowledges its utter colonization by its own procedure of serially confessing its sources. The story, which initially believed itself to be operating on a blank page, moving into a horizon of possibility, is dismayed by the likelihood that it has wandered instead into a sucking undertow of bungled authorial good intentions, the pathetic desire to write a story that will acknowledge its colonial crimes and historical debts. The Winnebago, moving with such innocent optimism across deserted Western spaces, may be blundering into a valley of palimpsest. The story is belated.",

There's a hint of wistfulness in her demeanor, perhaps regret for opportunities missed or paths not taken. Yet, as she walks further from campus, she seems to relax, finding comfort in the familiar sights of children playing on cracked sidewalks and elderly neighbors tending to small garden plots. Joanie's emotional state is one of quiet contemplation, tinged with a mix of envy and resignation towards the students, but also a growing appreciation for the authenticity of her own surroundings. Her perspective on the university students is neither wholly positive nor negative, but rather a nuanced understanding of the differences in their lived experiences and the invisible barriers that separate their worlds.",

Between gulps of golden lager, the Oktoberfesters danced to the rhythm of an oompah band; their feet moved in sync with the tufts of grass beneath their worn-out shoes, softened by years of celebration. Children darted through the throng, their laughter mingling with the adults’ exuberant cheers, clutching gingerbread hearts inscribed with sugary phrases.

She could see the outline of the person's feet, uncomfortably close, through the gap beneath the partition. Placing a shaky hand on the cool metal of the stall door, she prayed silently for a quick escape.

        "AI-edited": "Bangkok’s Chinatown, Old Town, and waterfront areas have undergone subtle but impactful changes, reshaping the identity of these historic neighborhoods. The introduction of sleek, modern public transport options like the MRT extension and revamped ferry services has stitched these areas closer to the city's main arteries, making them more accessible than ever. Old shophouses in Chinatown are being turned into hip cafes and boutique hotels, blending the charm of history with modern comfort. The Old Town now features immersive experiences such as bamboo weaving and traditional dance workshops, curated to actively involve tourists and locals alike in Thailand's rich cultural tapestry. Down by the waterfront, traditional food stalls now sit side by side with chic eateries that offer fresh, farm-to-table Thai cuisine. These new businesses are not just catering to tourists; they are fostering a vibrant community where locals and visitors coexist and interact. Significant as modern developments may be, heritage preservation has remained a priority. These improvements in access and vibrancy have truly transformed these neighborhoods, but the authenticity and spirit of Bangkok's past have been carefully maintained."

In recent years, tour guides at places like the Owens-Thomas House and Slave Quarters are focusing more on the stories of enslaved people, offering visitors a fuller historical picture. Savannah is also a beacon for young creatives, thanks in part to the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD), and the city now has many contemporary galleries as well as newer, locally focused artist hubs like Sulfur Studios. Venture outside of the Historic District, too: In the city’s east and west, you can find a variety of Black- and immigrant-owned restaurants and bars; and the up-and-coming Starland District has plenty of attractions. But be warned — it’s not uncommon for visitors to fall in love with the city and become locals.",

Perhaps it had grown crowded with those like R., who’d felt curious to see what it held. It appeared as though at the far end of the side room it opened to another enormous indoor space, one perhaps as without boundary as the one that R. had just left.

        "AI-edited": "After a long week of work and family obligations, Mary and Thomas settled onto their worn leather couch on Saturday evening, eager to unwind with a documentary about family dynamics. Little did they know that this seemingly innocuous choice would ignite a profound journey of self-reflection. As the film progressed, they unexpectedly related to the on-screen narratives. Thomas noticed Mary's reactions during scenes about parent-child conflicts. Her eyes narrowed and her lips pursed ever so slightly, a reaction Thomas recognized from their own heated discussions about their children's upbringing. When the credits rolled, an awkward silence filled the room, neither sure how to broach the subject weighing on their minds. It was Mary who finally spoke, her voice trembling slightly as she mentioned how the film's portrayal of a teenager's rebellion reminded her of their own daughter's recent outbursts and late-night sneaking out. They began to discuss their children's struggles and their own parenting approaches openly. The conversation meandered through their hopes, fears, and regrets, touching on aspects of their relationship they had long avoided. As the night wore on, they found themselves sitting closer, their voices softer, rediscovering the tender intimacy of their early marriage, when every shared moment felt charged with possibility. They went to bed feeling closer, with a new perspective on their family."

Nadia had been estranged from her family since she had completed university and announced, to their anger and fear and dismay, that she would henceforth live on her own. She passed their house one afternoon on purpose, not to speak with them, just to see from the outside if they were there and well, but the home she had forsaken looked deserted, with no sign of inhabitants or life. When she visited again, it was gone, unrecognizable, the building crushed by the force of a bomb that weighed as much as a compact automobile. Nadia would never be able to determine what had become of her family, but she always hoped that they had found a way to depart unharmed, abandoning the city to the predations of warriors on both sides, who seemed content to flatten it in order to possess it.",

Then, in the electronics section, sitting alone in its display case with a shiny and sleek orange strap, was the Fitbit Inspire 3. It was perfect. I’d always wanted one.

So what should have taken me twenty minutes was going to take an hour and a half. Sitting in the back of the J-23B with the air-conditioning barely working, I stared out the window as we crawled through residential neighborhoods whose houses were all flying flags. There was no breeze, and the flags hung limply. Once in a while, there’d be a sign stuck in a window that said “Peace” or “No War,” or something to that effect, but for the most part everyone was on the same page. Ten minutes into the ride, I was sweating heavily; rivulets ran from my armpits down my sides and collected in the elastic of my underwear. This is what it must feel like for soldiers sitting on the transport, heading to battle, I thought. I was wearing shorts, and my thighs adhered to the bus seat, so that whenever I shifted my skin peeled away from the plastic. The other passengers were old hands and had come equipped with things to fan themselves with, like newspapers and magazines and even a flattened cereal box. I retrieved a discarded supermarket circular from under the seat in front of me and tried to use it, but the paper was too thin and kept flopping over, so I wasn’t able to generate any current. I folded it four times, and then four more times, and then gave up and tossed it back under the seat where I’d found it. A woman looked at me with accusation. She was waving a library book in front of her face.",

For a brief moment, the briefest moment—the eye doesn’t have time to take it all in, the eye casts about—the dull, hot darkness overhead becomes a starry sky, a dark-blue cupola with huge, shimmering stars that seem startlingly close. “Ahhhhh!” comes the sound from below, and then the light goes out, and again there’s darkness, darker even than before. And again the click, and the fantastic, multicolored stars, like spinning Ferris wheels, and that very same “air…shining with the blue fire”—a momentary vision—and again gloom. And again the clatter of a falling coin, followed by the click—the glorious vision, don’t go, stay with us!—and again the blow of darkness. The sinners stand as though enchanted, their faces lifted. A path has opened in the darkness, a promise has been made, evidence has been presented: all will be saved, no explanations necessary—the magical dark-blue abyss, raised above us by nameless artists, speaks for itself, sings in a wordless language. The blue flows down toward the garlands of fruit and leaves.… Everything disappears, but again and again the lights flash on, the fête is endless, and any minute now the angels will begin to sing. Let there be light!",

Suddenly, one by one, small lights began to appear on the vast curtain that had been draped over the stage. The effect was subtle at first, like shy stars emerging into view. A gasp rippled through the crowd as the simulated starlight brightened, illuminating the theater with a gentle glow. An almost sacred stillness filled the air. Each person was entranced by the ethereal scene, as if the theater lay atop a quiet mountaintop far from the noise of the world. Even the critical audience members found themselves captivated by the gentle glow. Time expanded, prolonging the anticipation between twinkles. Each spark of light seemed to draw every person in, a personal revelation for each spectator. As the sequence gradually intensified, filling the hall with a warmth that defied the vast coldness it evoked, the audience realized they were part of the spectacle."

Maybe Mandy spent the night awake, rigid, waiting to see if Roy would get up as if to use the bathroom, say her name in a loud whisper, and then, on receiving no response, creep trembling down the stairs toward the fold-out bed. I don’t know what it was really like, but I do know that, every unhappy night I slept in that fairly comfortable bed, I wondered if Roy would come down those stairs. I listened for his step and thought at some length about what he would say or do, and how I’d respond. When he didn’t come, not once, I cursed the effortless happiness of married people.",

I liked her name, which was Madeleine. She picked up my doll and began to walk her in silly, jouncing steps around the stump, seesawing her legs; I snatched her back. My belief in my dolls, at that point, was in a delicate balance. I knew that they were inert plastic and could be tumbled without consequences upside down and half naked in the toy box. At the same time, I seemed to feel the complex sensibility of each one, like an extra skin stretched taut and responsive, both in my mind and quite outside of me.

The towels had been washed, yes, but they were so old and threadbare that they’d forgotten how to be towels. Those towels had dementia. And that thin metal rod had been pulled out of the wall so often by clumsy guests that it barely supported the weight of the towels. But no matter—she still draped the towels with an eye-pleasing symmetry. Then she sprayed minty soap into the sink and the shower, did a quick wipe with her hand towel, and ran hot water to wash the soap down the drain. She sprayed the toilet bowl, flushed, and repeated the process. She didn’t have to scrub at any stains because of the departed guest’s good manners. She knew she’d only cleaned the surface of things, but the soap’s strong minty smell would make it seem as if she’d cleaned more thoroughly.",

When I recovered, we were invited to a party at a one-room adobe house on the outskirts of town. Henry and Patalarga were both on edge, drinking more than usual, because this was the town where Tania lived; apparently she’d been at the show, and might reappear at any moment. I was too ill to worry about that: taking a breath was like swallowing sharp knives, and my head felt as if it might separate from my neck and just float away into the threatening Andean sky. But everyone was exceedingly kind, paying special attention to feeding me and getting me drunk. The liquor helped, and it felt nice to be doted upon. When I started turning blue, the owner of the home, a squat gray-haired man named Cayetano, asked if I wanted a jacket. I nodded enthusiastically, and he rose and walked to the refrigerator, standing before its open door, as if contemplating a snack. I thought, He’s making fun of me, and I heard Henry and Patalarga snickering. But then Cayetano opened the vegetable drawer and took out a pair of wool socks. He tossed them to me, and when he opened the door a little farther I saw that the refrigerator was, in fact, being used as a wardrobe. There were mittens in the butter tray, sweaters and jackets hanging from a wooden bar nailed to the inside walls. Only then did I notice the few perishables sitting on the counter. In this cold, of course, they were in no danger of spoiling.",

There was nothing poetic about the cold, just a persistent ache that seeped into our bones and made each day drag on. The looming party, tucked away in a shabby third-floor walk-up that seemed cobbled together from salvage furniture and mismatched decor, was a curious beacon amid our cold routine. We shed our layers by the door, readjusting to the warmth, and it felt oddly tender. Ellery, who I hadn't seen since high school, offered an arm around my shoulder, a gesture once dismissed as collegial but now acting like balm to chill-wearied skin. The discovery came not in the form of old jokes rekindled, but in quiet, unexpected confessions shared over the soft clink of dollar-store glasses. Joel spoke of his mother's faltering memory, while Mia laughed that strange, hollow laugh that hinted at more pain than joy, but here we found a sense of shared warmth not from the radiators or mismatched throws, but from each other, recognizing the weariness in our eyes. It was supportive not despite the discomfort, but precisely because of it. And as the paths back home were trodden once more, through the wind and biting snow, what had been shared made the world less bearable."

Maybe I shouldn’t have done this, but I bought a bag of tumbled stones to plant around the yard. She found every tiger’s eye, green agate and red jasper. With each, she’d rush inside, sweaty-palmed, offering it to me. And I’d confirm, repeatedly, what she had discovered: Life is also beautiful.",

Carol glanced at the girls; Estella was looking supercilious, Ada was eating her bread with greasy, dream-faced absorption.

She wills the message to clarify. But there is only his face—slightly amused, maybe making a joke of the afternoon. Then she sees briefly, persuasively from behind his glaucoma: the sunlight in the living room had fired a blob of gold that had gone in, then out, then back in, then back out of his granddaughter’s mouth, and he had been delighted. Gold, for the Chinese, is even more golden—it is everything. His granddaughter is someone who can eat fire, money, the sun, but only halfway. She lacks the courage to fully assimilate these things and has to spit them back out. A fool, or, even worse, a coward. She must be encouraged.

Because in that moment, with my girl dancing in a dress chosen with love by a grandmother she barely knew, I realized that some connections don't need words or even physical presence.

Through the windows, against a clear autumn sky, I could see the Aosta mountains, arid and brown. No one was with him when my red-haired friend and I entered the hospital room. Around the next bed, a large family was gathered, chattering loudly as they took turns spooning broth into the mouth of an old man with amputated legs.

In some cases, the external pressures or risks tied to coming out can compromise well-being, so the pace at which she moves forward is key. Support her by creating a safe, loving environment where she feels seen and valued regardless of her public declarations. Sometimes growth isn't in public announcements or social media posts but found in small steps of self-recognition and moments of authenticity. The heart of self-acceptance lies in understanding herself, not meeting societal expectations."

In contrast, Masha excelled in school with a quiet efficiency, each top grade as hidden and unassuming as a tucked-away spring flower. Her hobbies were more focused—watercolor painting and birdwatching, pursuits that required patience and stillness, mirroring her steady, thoughtful nature. While Volechka's room was a kaleidoscope of cluttered inspirations, Masha's space was a sanctuary of neatness and intention, a meticulous order that allowed her to breathe.

The work could not be continued, and the painters sat in their van, hoping for an improvement. Earlier, while they were working, there had been raised voices in the house, an altercation that occasionally gave way to silence before beginning again. The older painter, whose English was better than his brother’s, reported that it had to do with money and the condition of the land. “The pension is what I’m good for,” the crippled man repeatedly insisted. “Amn’t I here for the few bob I bring in?” The pension became the heart of what was so crossly talked about, how it was spent in ways it shouldn’t be, how the crippled man didn’t have it for himself. The painters lost interest, but the voices went on and could still be heard when one or other of them left the van to look at the sky.",

I could almost hear the headlines being written: \"First Ladies Battle It Out in Kitchenware Aisle.\" As we examined a set of non-stick pans, I caught a glimpse of a reporter eagerly anticipating some Cold War catfight. The reality was far more mundane: two women, thrust into roles they never asked for, finding common ground over the universal need for decent cookware. Mrs. Gorbachev confided that she'd always wanted to try making blini on an American skillet. I admitted my own culinary disasters involving borscht. We shared a quiet laugh, a moment of genuine connection lost on the frenzied press. As we moved to the checkout, a journalist shouted, \"Mrs. Gorbachev, are American products superior?\" She paused, then replied with a wry smile, \"In some ways, yes. In others, no. Much like our countries, I suppose.\" The nuance of her answer went unnoticed in the rush to file sensationalized headlines about Cold War tensions playing out in a department store.

Over time, as they chatted intermittently, it emerged that both of them would have preferred majoring in studio art—Irene’s major was product design and Eddie’s was economics—and that neither of them had parents who would have been O.K. with this. Eddie had grown up on a farm in southwest Minnesota, and Irene was a dentist’s daughter from St. Cloud.

In summer he probably would have bobbed up sooner.” Lara pushed open the door to the bar and stepped inside.",

The man's weathered face bore the marks of countless stories. She hesitated, her hand gripping the railing more tightly than necessary. The bartender, sensing the tension, paused mid-pour, his eyes flicking between the two. The enormous man's expression remained unreadable, but there was a subtle shift in his posture, a barely perceptible tilt of his head. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever might come next. As she approached, the air seemed to thicken, the ambient noise of the bar fading into the background. Time slowed, each step feeling like an eternity. When she finally reached the bar, mere inches from the man, she noticed a small, tattered photograph peeking out from his shirt pocket. In that moment, something unspoken passed between them, a flicker of recognition or perhaps a shared secret. The man's eyes softened slightly, and he shifted slightly, making room for her at the bar without a word."

        "Human-Written": "She never confronted Frank. Instead, on quiet mornings in the library she went online and read about the bacterium she had unwittingly hosted in her body for years. Chlamydia trachomatis, derived from the Greek word for “cloak,” may have originated in amphibians, most likely frogs. She pored over the microscopic images on the screen, magnified into bulging, purple, misshapen globules, and thought of them invading and contaminating the pink flesh of her cervix and womb and tubes. She began to detest Frank’s bodily presence, his smell, the sound of his chewing. In the evenings, they ate in silence. When Frank moved to clear the dishes—or do any task in the kitchen—she lifted her hand, “Leave that, I’ll do it,” and meekly he acquiesced. He could have left. She could have asked him to leave, she could have screamed, Go on, get out! Go to one of your fancy women. But she was not a screamer, any more than he was. Eventually, she summoned the courage to see an S.T.I. consultant in a private clinic and told the woman the whole story. The tests came back positive for chlamydia, negative for everything else. She had been a virgin, a novice on her wedding night. She had assumed that the pain and discomfort and discharge were associated with intercourse. Sitting there in the privacy of the doctor’s office, Frances started to cry for the fool of a woman she had been. She went home, started a course of antibiotics, and went to bed for the weekend, full of hatred for Frank and for her own body, befouled with his filthy bacteria.",

They went to an old market, the Plaza Redonda, and decided not to buy any bootleg DVDs because they didn’t want to carry them around all day and lose them. They went into a tapas place and ate about fifty euros’ worth of the little things along the counter. They went to a bar with a big screen, to watch the English football. They had their first beers, slowly, and a few more, slowly, till the match was over, and they went for a stroll. They found a small corner bar with a very good-looking waitress, and they stayed there till it was dark. They talked more than they had all week.

Each diaper change and midnight feeding was a deeply intimate moment that left her both vulnerable and fiercely protective. Sometimes, the walls closed in, and she questioned everything, especially during the deep stretches of night when the doubts were loudest. Yet, there were also those fleeting moments of connection—soft coos and tiny, trusting hands—that made her heart swell in a way she couldn’t articulate. Jeanne’s old life seemed distant, her pre-motherhood self a whisper on the edge of memory. She cherished how her perception of love had transformed, becoming something raw and unpolished, like a gemstone still embedded in rock. Sitting alone in the dim light, she realized that motherhood was not about being a perfect caretaker but about growing alongside her child, embracing the imperfections with a kind of quiet grace.

        "AI-edited": "Jeanne sat in the dusky quiet of the nursery, the gentle whir of the old ceiling fan breaking the stillness. She watched her baby's chest rise and fall, feeling a complex mix of pride and exhaustion. Motherhood was not the glorified reverie she'd read about in magazines, but a peculiar, almost isolating experience. Each diaper change and midnight feeding was a deeply intimate moment that left her both vulnerable and protective. Sometimes, the walls closed in, and she questioned everything, especially during the deep stretches of night when the doubts were loudest. Yet, there were also those fleeting moments of connection—soft coos and tiny, trusting hands—that made her heart expand in a way she couldn't articulate. Jeanne's old life seemed distant, her pre-motherhood self faded into the background. Her perception of love had transformed into something raw and unpolished, like a gemstone still embedded in rock. Sitting alone in the dim light, she understood motherhood wasn't about perfection but about growing alongside her child."

My father said, If he wants to, he can. He was rinsing vegetables at the time—he could cook a few simple dishes, but refused to touch potatoes or radishes, because when he got sent down to the countryside that was all he had to eat and they wrecked his stomach. Nowadays when he saw them at the vegetable market he’d walk quickly by. I said, Then what happens after I’m dead? Can I get revenge? He said, No, you’d be completely defeated. I said, Are you going to die? He said, Yes, I might die at any moment. The human body has a heart in it, about the size of your fist, and when it stops beating you die. I said, Why would it stop? It’s beating now, it will beat tomorrow—why would it stop one day? He said, It’s beating now, but it might not tomorrow, though your heart is very healthy—you aren’t going to die because of that. I said, How would you know? He said, I listened to it when you were born. I heard your heart and it’s a healthy one. Besides, my heart has problems, so the probability is that yours doesn’t—those are reasonable odds. Anyway let’s leave it at that. The next time Big Fatty wants to hit you, you should run away as fast as you can, then you won’t die.",

I felt half-scared of them, half-linked with them, and didn’t know which feeling was most real. I reached inside my shirt and held the rings for a moment in my cupped hand. Thomas’s face, flat and beautifully misshapen, rippled in me like a reflection in water. There was a boy at my side, trying to push a cow out of the way. Thomas’s face stretched unrecognizably on the moving water. The boy came suddenly around the cow and tore my chain off my neck. I screamed; the boy flashed down the street. I was after him. My legs are long and I almost had him but couldn’t grab him, because Sonny was screaming, forgotten, in my arms. I darted back to Katya, who was standing motionless, and thrust Sonny at her. The boy was a quick pixilation of limbs, disappearing. Katya shouted, “Janice!” and I ran. The boy was a bright movement that I chased like a creature with a single instinct. I turned a corner, stumbled into a pothole full of warm brown water, and nearly fell. I staggered and bent to catch myself with my hands. I looked up; he was gone. I whipped my head around, looking, my instinct trying to leap in every direction—but it had nothing to leap at. I panted heavily, sweat running into my eyes. Ragged women holding children stared at me. Faces peered from the broken hole of a window. Skeletal dogs, fierce and cringing, watched with starving eyes. My instinct felt them all as it felt itself: quick force in slow mammal bodies; soft brain in hard bone; a machine of thoughts; a machine of sex; the dark radiance of emotions; the personality; eyes, nose, mouth. A little boy with a large round head pointed at me and said words I couldn’t understand. My instinct broke; everything that had been joined was now in pieces again. I put my face in my hands and cried like an animal.",

But now the branches of the tree were bare, the weather was wintry, we were back in lockdown; when I stood at the window I felt a warning chill coming off the glass. It was three o’clock on a November afternoon and I hadn’t turned on the light.

Their gray-tinged faces and slightly labored breathing marked the passage of time I tried to ignore. The house was just as I remembered it, but with a strange, pervasive silence. As I unpacked my suitcase, a sense of ease settled in, broken only by Gerard's absence. He had always been the one to fill the space with his brisk energy and constant chatter.

        "Human-Written": "It was mid-April by the time my wife and I returned from Switzerland. Tim and Tim II, who’d been cared for in our absence by our housekeeper, Florencia, were there to greet us, acting out their ecstasy on the doorstep and then carrying it into the living room with such an excess of animation that it was all but impossible to get our bags in the door before giving them their treats, a thorough back-scratching, and a cooed rehearsal of the little endearments they were used to. It was good to be home, back to a real community, after all that time spent living in a sterile apartment in Basel, and, what with making the rounds of the neighbors and settling in both at home and at work, it wasn’t till some weeks later that I thought of Gerard. No one had seen him, save for Mary Martinson, who’d run into him in the parking lot at the mall, and he’d refused all invitations to dinner, casual get-togethers, ice-skating on the lake, even the annual Rites of Spring fund-raiser at the clubhouse. Mary said that he’d seemed distracted and that she’d tried to engage him in conversation, thinking he was still locked in that first stage of grieving and just needed a little nudge to get him on track again, but he’d been abrupt with her. And she didn’t like to mention it but he was unkempt—and he smelled worse than ever. It was startling, she said. Even outdoors, standing over the open trunk of his car, which was entirely filled, she couldn’t help noticing, with something called Rat Chow, even with the wind blowing and a lingering chill in the air, he gave off a powerful reek of sadness and body odor. Someone needed to look in on him, that was her opinion.",

My room was the attic of an old house, with generous floor space and not much headroom. But, being the former maid’s quarters, it had its own bathroom. Two other scholarship students, who were in their final year in Modern Languages, lived on the second floor. Their names were Kay and Beverly. In the high-ceilinged but chopped-up rooms of the ground floor lived a medical student who was hardly ever home, and his wife, Beth, who was home all the time, because they had two very young children. Beth was the house manager and rent collector, and she was often feuding with the second-floor girls over the way they washed their clothes in the bathroom and hung them there to dry.

At the supermarket, his mind felt crowded as he navigated the aisles; they felt like a maze. He wandered, half-heartedly picking up a bag of apples and a box of spaghetti. There was something serene about navigating the mundane tasks; it felt like a necessary disconnection. He passed a young couple debating between two brands of cereal and caught a snippet of their conversation—he felt a distant ache. Back at the dairy section, he hesitated, milk or almond milk? A trivial choice masking a deeper indecision. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as if mimicking his inner disquietude, but he finished his errand with a sense of muted accomplishment. As he loaded the bags into his car, he saw a mother with her toddler, their laughter cutting through the steady drizzle. He sat in the driver's seat for a moment, listening to the patter on the windshield, before driving off into the grey afternoon."

I had learned from experience not to touch on personal or intimate matters (a bit like sticking to sports when chatting with strangers in bars), so we talked about her family, which in those conversations remained as abstract as a Cubist poem, or her son’s school, or her job; she was still at the same office, and over the years she had got to know all about her colleagues and their lives, and all the problems the executives were having—those secrets gave her an intense and perhaps excessive pleasure. On one occasion, I tried to get her to say something about her husband, but she clammed up at that. You deserve the best, I told her. That’s strange, Clara replied. What’s strange? I asked. It’s strange that you should say that—you, of all people, she said. I quickly tried to change the subject, claimed I was running out of coins (I’ve never had a phone of my own, and never will—I always called from a public phone booth), hurriedly said goodbye, and hung up. I realized I couldn’t face another argument with Clara; I couldn’t listen to her working up another one of her endless justifications.",

From the hot tub, John watched her pace in her robe and an old swimsuit in a faded tropical print that probably belonged to one of the girls. It was nice to drift a little in the water, to glide to the other side of the tub, holding his coffee above the waterline, the jets churning away. The fig tree was bare, had been for a month now, but the persimmon trees were full. The kids should bake cookies when they get here, he thought, persimmon cookies. Wasn’t that what Linda used to make, when the kids were little? Or what else—jam, maybe? All this fruit going to waste, it was disgusting. He’d get the yard guy to pick a few crates of persimmons before the kids came, so that all they’d have to do was bake them. Linda would know where to find the recipe.",

The steam rose from the water, scented with eucalyptus and mint, and Ryan closed his eyes, soaking in the warmth. His mind drifted to the summers of his childhood, when his family would gather at his grandparents' orchard, picking peaches and plums that would become pies and jams. He remembered the rough skin of the fruit, the sweetness of the juice, and the way his grandmother's kitchen would fill with the aroma of sugar and spices, transporting him to a time when life was simpler, and the only worry was what flavor of pie to make next. His thoughts turned to Emma, who had taken up the tradition of baking with their own children, teaching them the secrets of his grandmother's recipes. He recalled the look of concentration on their faces as they mixed and measured, the way they'd giggle and steal tastes of the dough. As he sat, Ryan felt grateful for these small, everyday moments, the ones that wove together the intricate tapestry of their lives, fabric of their family's story. He opened his eyes to find Emma watching him from the kitchen window, a gentle smile on her face. She raised her cup in a silent toast, and Ryan nodded in response, feeling the warmth of the water and the love of his family envelop him."

The vision she’d offered earlier—the pig, the dog—now came fully into view, though Kromer felt anything but unsympathetic. She brushed him off, after he’d gained a brief, delicious sensation of her long knobbed spine beneath his fingers, and staggered to the toilet to finish her heaves. Kromer’s special literacy was, it now seemed, something worse than a complete dead loss on the human scoreboard. It was positively toxic, able to compel vomit from gorgeous women. He thought with relief how, on her knees, at least, Renee would be spared any view of the VHS tapes stacked on the porcelain tank.",

The coffee tasted bitter, and the news headlines on her phone only added to her growing anxiety. As she rushed to get ready for her shift at Kromer's, she knocked over her favorite mug, shattering it on the tile floor. The sound still echoed in her mind as she arrived at the bakery, where the sweet aroma of freshly baked pastries usually lifted her spirits. Today, the smell made her feel sick. The tension in the kitchen was palpable, with the head baker, Herr Kromer, breathing down everyone's necks as they prepped for the lunch rush. Renee's colleague, Emma, a shy and reserved young woman with a talent for crafting intricate sugar flowers, seemed on the verge of tears, her eyes red-rimmed from a sleepless night. As Renee began to assemble the pastry trays, her hands trembled, and the delicate layers of dough seemed to blur together. The clanging of pots and pans, the muffled arguments between the kitchen staff, and the incessant beeping of the display cases all conspired against her fragile nerves. Then she felt the first wave of nausea wash over her, a cold sweat breaking out on her forehead.

Bridget stayed with them for two months, and would have felt guilty about mooching, if they hadn’t so clearly wanted to gather around themselves a collection of misfits to take care of. In addition to Bridget, they often hosted an assortment of hard-drinking Germans from Hans/Anders’s work, whatever it was, and Mei Ling, a Chinese-Canadian woman who had a cluster of gray whiskers on her otherwise smooth cheek, like a tuft of crabgrass thriving on a lawn. Mei Ling’s reasons for being in Barcelona were unclear; whenever Bridget talked to her, she scowled and left the room. Angela said that she was very depressed.",

This humble dessert, typically served from street carts or markets, is a masterclass in balancing flavors and textures. The sweetness of ripe mango, often sourced from local farms, is the star of the show, but it's the supporting cast of ingredients that elevates the mangonada to iconic status. A sprinkle of spicy Tajín, a tangy drizzle of lime juice, and a pinch of salt all work in harmony to awaken the taste buds. The crunch of toasted coconut flakes or crushed peanuts adds a satisfying depth, while the creamy coolness of a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream provides a soothing respite from the sweltering temperatures. But what truly sets the mangonada apart is its ability to evoke a sense of nostalgia and community. On sweltering summer afternoons, families and friends gather around mangonada vendors, sharing laughter and stories as they savor each bite. It's a moment of collective indulgence, a fleeting escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life.

        "Human-Written": "When the summer sun screams across Mexico’s city streets and sandy beaches, mangonadas come to the rescue. Also called chamangos, they can be made with any combination of mango sorbet, chopped fresh mango or mango purée, and may or may not be spiked, but they’ll always contain the salty, spicy and tangy flavors of Tajín and chamoy. Tajín, a chile-lime salt, is a delicious addition to sweet and savory foods alike. Its sister condiment, chamoy, is traditionally made from fermented fruit, salt, sugar and chiles. Depending on your location, you can find Tajín, chamoy and tamarind straws — their sour, chewy coating adds an extra tickle of tartness — at supermarkets or Latin American grocers; all three are available online.",

In the morning, he struggled to free himself from the children, who overwhelmed him with lighthearted questions: How far was the lake? Would it still be frozen? Had he remembered the rubber raft? He went into the darkroom to develop the plate; he dried it and placed it beside the plate that he had made seven days earlier. He examined both under the microscope: good, they were identical; he could leave in tranquillity. But then he had a scruple and looked more carefully, and realized that there was something new—not a big thing, a barely perceptible spot, but it wasn’t there on the old plate. When something like this shows up, ninety-nine times out of a hundred it’s a speck of dust (one can’t be too clean in the workplace) or a microscopic defect in the emulsion; but there is also the minuscule probability that it’s a nova, and one has to make a report, subject to confirmation.

His mind kept wandering to the upcoming weekend outing with Judith and the children, the promise of a carefree afternoon by the lake and the unspoken words that had been hanging between them like a challenge since their argument the night before. But as he examined the plate, his gaze lingered on a faint, almost imperceptible spot that seemed out of place. He felt a flutter in his chest, a spark of excitement tempered by a dash of skepticism. Could this be a nova, a celestial event of a lifetime, hidden in the vast expanse of the night sky? Ramón's thoughts raced as he replayed the observations in his mind, weighing the possibilities with a mix of excitement and trepidation. He knew he had to verify the finding, but a part of him hesitated, fearing the disruption it could bring to his carefully laid plans. His plans might be sacrificed to scientific curiosity. Judith would understand, wouldn't she? The children would forgive him, eventually. But as he stood there, the plate still wet in his hands, Ramón felt the familiar tug between his dual identities."

It was a sound that seemed to reverberate deep within my chest, like the ominous rumble of thunder on a summer evening, making my skin prickle with a mix of fear and anticipation. I felt a flutter in my chest, a mix of excitement and trepidation. My gaze drifted to the window, where the curtains billowed like a sigh. The engine's growl was low and menacing, a sound that seemed to be saying, \"I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere.\" The sound was a challenge. I took a step forward, my hand reaching to push aside the curtain, but then hesitated. I hesitated, unsure if I really wanted to know what was on the other side. The engine revved again. It was as if the air around me seemed to vibrate, charged with an electric tension that seemed to crackle with possibility. And then, just as suddenly as it had started, the engine fell silent, leaving behind an unsettling stillness that pulsed with anticipation."

This might be the frozen resistance—were he to look right at her and tell her he didn’t, she would keep the appointment and go. He knew this. Something in him, though, some terrible weakness or lack of values, could not tell her. It felt like a muscle he did not have. He didn’t know why; he just could not do it, or even pray to do it. She believed he was good, serious in his values. Part of him seemed willing to more or less just about lie to someone with that kind of faith and trust, and what did that make him? How could such a type of individual even pray? What it really felt like was a taste of the reality of what might be meant by Hell. Lane Dean had never believed in Hell as a lake of fire or a loving God consigning folks to a burning lake of fire—he knew in his heart this was not true. What he believed in was a living God of compassion and love and the possibility of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ through whom this love was enacted in human time. But sitting here beside this girl as unknown to him now as outer space, waiting for whatever she might say to unfreeze him, now he felt like he could see the edge or outline of what a real vision of Hell might be. It was of two great and terrible armies within himself, opposed and facing each other, silent. There would be battle but no victor. Or never a battle—the armies would stay like that, motionless, looking across at each other, and seeing therein something so different and alien from themselves that they could not understand, could not hear each other’s speech as even words or read anything from what their face looked like, frozen like that, opposed and uncomprehending, for all human time.

        "AI-edited": "Here's the paragraph with formatting and grammatical issues fixed:Lane Dean's inner turmoil stems from the disconnect between his desire for authenticity and his fear of rejection. He's trapped in a cycle of self-deception, convincing himself that omitting the truth is a necessary evil to preserve his relationship. His secrets are suffocating him. He's torn between the comfort of familiarity and the anguish of uncertainty, unsure which path will ultimately lead to heartbreak. Lane's mind is a battleground, where the rational voice of self-preservation clashes with the emotional cry for vulnerability. He's haunted by the memory of his past relationships, where honesty was met with abandonment, and the fear of being left behind still lingers. As he struggles to reconcile his true feelings with the expectations of his girlfriend, Lane's sense of identity begins to fray. He's no longer certain who he is or what he wants, only that he's suffocating under the pressure of his own dishonesty. The silence between them grows. He's desperate to break free from the shackles of his own making, but the fear of losing her paralyzes him. In this limbo, Lane is forced to confront the darkest corners of his own psyche."

Their parents, beaming with excitement, welcomed them with open arms, the initial awkwardness of reunion dissipating as they settled into the comforting routine of home. Munna, the more outgoing of the two, regaled their family with tales of pranks and mischief, like the time they convinced their cousin that the village well was haunted by a mischievous spirit while Chottu listened intently, his eyes sparkling with amusement. They fell into a rhythm of lazy mornings, spent lounging in the courtyard, and afternoons exploring the surrounding fields, rediscovering the hidden streams and secret glades of their childhood, where they had spent countless hours exploring and dreaming together. Yet, amidst the warmth and comfort, subtle tensions simmered beneath the surface. Munna's stories of school began to reveal a hint of bravado to prove himself while Chottu's quiet reserve masked a deep-seated anxiety about the future. Old rivalries and alliances began to resurface as they struggled to reconcile their diverging paths with the unbreakable ties of their childhood, and the memories of their shared past began to feel like a double-edged sword, both a source of comfort and a reminder of the distance growing between them. The summer air pulsed with the promise of adventure, but also the uncertainty of growing up as they grappled with the realization that their lives were slowly drifting apart, like the branches of the ancient banyan tree that stood sentinel over their village."

What really killed her was how difficult it was to communicate with Sasha when they were apart. Sasha couldn’t call Olga, because of her husband, but Olga called him often. Usually, they were assisted by Andrei, Sasha’s alcoholic roommate, a blind but not fully deaf man, who would hand-sign with Sasha and then translate to Olga. But he could convey only certain information, not the feelings! He was filthy-minded and rude, and he was often drunk! He made fun of Olga when she asked him to translate how much she missed and loved Sasha, and he never said that Sasha missed her, too. Olga wasn’t sure if Andrei was choosing not to translate that part, or if Sasha didn’t say that he loved her because Andrei’s presence made him shy. At the end of a phone call, Olga would ask Andrei to pass the phone to Sasha so that she could listen to his breathing. Sometimes Olga would sing to him. Sasha said that, even though he couldn’t hear her, he could feel the vibrations. Olga knew a lot of weepy ballads, and she would sing them as loudly as she could. This was often more eloquent than Andrei’s dumb translations. If only the phone connection were better. There were times when the call was disconnected mid-song. Olga would find herself all alone, hundreds of miles from Sasha, sitting on the low wooden stool in the dark hall of her apartment with that greasy old receiver beeping at her like an angry siren, making her want to die.",

Locals know the best spots are hiding in plain sight, and an appreciation for beloved classics and an openness to all that’s new define the City of Angels. Well, that and embracing the drives.",

These little transactions, informed as they were by a sincere curiosity about the lives of others, which was common to all the inhabitants of Pringles, turned out to be rich in information, and that is how we learned that the Musical Brain was being exhibited next door, in the lobby of the Spanish Theatre. The news was an excuse to finish with the dinner, which all of us were finding tedious.",

The Old Port's cobblestone streets, lined with boutiques and eateries, offer a charming, low-key alternative to more frenetic coastal towns. But it's the city's food scene, driven by a thriving community of artisans and farmers, that truly sets it apart. From the freshest, most expertly prepared seafood to innovative, farm-to-table restaurants, Portland's culinary landscape is a reflection of its resourceful, DIY spirit. However, this very authenticity is also what makes Portland vulnerable to the pressures of tourism. As the city's popularity grows, so do concerns about gentrification, rising housing costs, and the potential erosion of its unique character. Visitors must be mindful of their impact, respecting the city's scale and pace, and seeking out experiences that support local businesses and communities. Despite these challenges, Portland remains a refreshingly unpretentious destination, where the pleasures are simple, the people are genuine, and the sense of community is palpable. In the end, it's this very essence that will continue to draw visitors, as long as they're willing to approach the city with sensitivity and appreciation.",

To host travelers, culinary or otherwise, five boutique hotels have opened since 2020. The hotel construction, new high-end condo development and rising coastal real estate prices have exacerbated a housing crisis here.

In the woods, when it was done, the girls held each other and cried, half out of their minds, afraid of what the world was going to do to them. They were barefoot.

It was a humid night, the kind that made the air feel heavy and thick. The three women had gathered at our family's old cabin on the outskirts of town, surrounded by cypress trees that seemed to lean in, as if listening. My mother, a nurse, had brought her sister, a social worker, and Miss Agatha, a retired teacher, together to discuss a sensitive case involving a local family. But as they sat on the porch, sipping sweet tea, a stranger appeared out of nowhere. The women's instincts kicked in as they formed a tight circle, their eyes locked on the intruder. Without warning, Miss Agatha produced a small, pearl-handled pistol that had been passed down through generations of her family from her purse, while my mother's sister stood with her hands balled into fists. My mother, meanwhile, positioned herself between the stranger and the door, her eyes flashing with a fierce light. The standoff ended as quickly as it began, with the stranger backing away. The women exhaled slowly, their faces still tense. They knew that in a small town like ours, secrets had a way of spreading like rumors, and they wondered who might be watching, waiting for the other shoe to drop. As I looked on, I saw a glimmer of something in their eyes – a mix of pride and fear."

        "Human-Written": "I must have sat there for five minutes at least, just staring out into the rain, the cell clutched in my hand. I was wet through and I’d begun to shiver, so I turned the engine over and got the heater going. The mud was still flowing, I could see that much, and the white dog had disappeared, along with the couple from the U-Haul. Apparently they’d found shelter somewhere, in the little gas station-cum-grocery store that was La Conchita’s sole commercial establishment, or in one of the cars stalled behind me. There were people out on the pavement, hunched-over forms wading through the mud and shouting at one another, and I thought I heard the distant keening of a siren—police, fire, ambulance—and wondered how they expected to get through. You might find it hard to believe, but I really didn’t think much about the danger, though if another section of the hillside had let go we’d all have been buried, no doubt about that—no, I was more concerned about the package in the trunk. Why hadn’t they called me back? What were they waiting for? I could have been slogging down the road already, the cooler propped up on one shoulder, and somebody—I thought of an ambulance from the hospital—could have met me a couple miles up the freeway. But no, the ambulances would all be busy with the wreckage in front of me, with people trapped in their cars, bleeding from head wounds, their own organs ruptured, bones broken. Or in those houses. I turned my head to look out the passenger’s-side window at the ghost of La Conchita, at the rectangular grid of split-level homes and trailers up against the hillside which had been there ten minutes ago and were gone now. Just then, just as I turned, a streaming dark figure surged up against the car and a woman’s face appeared at the window. “Open up!” she demanded. “Open up!”",

Johanna was enchanted by the sprawling ranches, the vast skies, and the warm hospitality of the people we met along the way. As we explored the Texas landscape, I noticed how her initial fascination with the state's rough-and-tumble exterior gradually gave way to a deeper appreciation for its complexities and contradictions. In turn, I found myself learning more about her Bavarian heritage – the rich traditions, the folk music, and the hearty cuisine. Our cultural exchange was a two-way street, with each of us serving as the other's guide and student.

This is a principal memory of our early dating: we drove through Hill Country on weekends listening to Willie Nelson's twang. It thrilled me to see Johanna enchanted by the ranches, the huge skies, the warmth of everyone we met on the way. As we explored the Texas landscape, I noticed how her initial fascination with the state's rough-and-tumble exterior gradually gave way to a deeper appreciation for its complexities and contradictions. In turn, I found myself learning more about her Bavarian heritage – the rich traditions, the folk music, and the hearty cuisine. It wasn't just me. She educated me too, in the traditions and memories of her upbringing. It brought us a lot closer. There was a mutual curiosity and respect we had for each other that made it seem the easiest and most natural thing that the world had brought us together.",

In order to pretend to be my fiancée, and then my bride, Johanna had to spend time with me, getting to know me. She’s from Bavaria, Johanna is. She had herself a theory that Bavaria is the Texas of Germany. People in Bavaria are more conservative than your normal European leftist. They’re Catholic, if not exactly God-fearing. Plus, they like to wear leather jackets and such. Johanna wanted to know everything about Texas, and I was just the man to teach her. I took her to SXSW, which wasn’t the cattle call it is today. And oh my Lord if Johanna didn’t look good in a pair of bluejeans and cowboy boots.",

Her curiosity about Texas, on the other hand, was sparked by a childhood obsession with American Westerns and a romanticized notion of the Lone Star State's rugged individualism.
