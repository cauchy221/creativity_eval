The gossip—because she was not one of them, both the men and the women trusted her with indiscretions that they wouldn’t risk with one another. And when he had differences with guest conductors from Bulgaria or Japan or God knows where, their egos as complex as the pronunciation of their names, his exasperation found relief, as he unburdened himself in bed of the podium dramas and moved on to the haven of lovemaking. If she was in a low mood—the -bungles of an inefficient colleague at work, or her father’s “heart condition” and her mother’s long complaints over the telephone about his disobeying doctor’s orders with his whiskey-swilling golfers—the cello would join them in the bedroom and he’d play for her. Sometimes until she fell asleep to the low tender tones of what had become his voice, to her, the voice of that big curved instrument, its softly buffed surface and graceful bulk held close against his body, sharing the intimacy that was hers. At concerts, when his solo part came, she did not realize that she was smiling in recognition, that this was a voice she would have recognized anywhere, among other cellists bowing other instruments.",

Then suddenly a tiny shining dot appeared; it seemed to move, spinning slightly and drawing him to itself. The walls of the black cone grew still more black, and it became apparent that they were moving, as if this bright dot made them turn, pulling them into itself. He sensed the pull of this movement. The dot expanded, a sharp ray of light burst from it, and he headed toward it. The pain was with him, but it was also spinning and had ceased to be so tormenting. In this expanding dot the note “la” emerged, and he adjusted himself to it and moved in the direction of the light.

It's sign was a simple, handwritten scrawl: \"Curios & Oddments.\" The space was dimly lit, the smell of old paper and a hint of incense filling the air. The shelves, dusty and muddled, overflowed with mismatched items—brass telescopes, ceramic figurines, leather-bound books whose titles had become indiscernible over time. The shopkeeper, a middle-aged woman with wild, greying hair, looked up from a ledger as I entered. Her eyes, sharp and wary, softened slightly as she greeted me with a nod. There was a quiet intensity about her, as if she carried countless stories, waiting for the right listener. I felt a sense of dissonance; the shop was cluttered but not chaotic, strange but oddly welcoming. As I explored, running my fingers over the dust-covered artifacts, I realized I wasn't there to purchase anything. I had come to glimpse into another world, one curated meticulously by this enigmatic woman who knew every item by its history, not its price.",

All people were ordered below but many of them crumpled up against the rail and did not care if they were washed over. None of our family was sick however and now the wind has dropped and the sun has come out and those who did not care if they died in the filth a little while ago have got up and dragged themselves to be washed where the sailors are splashing buckets of water over the decks.

Something compelled Colbert Prentiss to depart from his text near the end of his sermon that morning. It might have been all the grandparents he saw before him, all the people who had struggled into old age only to find themselves parents once again. Clement Carson. Mr. and Mrs. Harrelson. The widow Anderson. Colbert’s own sister and brother-in-law. Mr. and Mrs. Apacka. Maggie and Noah Robinson. All of them the kind of people the preacher had built his rock on. The world was turned upside down when the mature ones were forced to do what the younger ones should be doing. Indeed, it was August, so why not have it snow outside, Colbert said to the hundreds. Why not lift our eyes to the sky and see all the pigs flying with their cherub wings?",

Ms. Blake waited in the coach station of eagerness and hope, unable to remember why she had ever experienced any tension whatsoever with regard to her very dearest friend from home, Leah Hanwell. The coach arrived, the doors opened. Human figures with faces streamed into view, and Ms. Blake’s brain sought a match between a recent memory and a material reality. Her mistake was to cling to ideas that properly belonged to previous visits. Ideas like “red hair,” and “black jeans/ black boots/ black T-shirt.” Fashions change. University is a time of experimentation and metamorphosis. The person who gripped her by the shoulders could no longer be mistaken for a member of a riot-grrrl band or a minor Berlin artist. She was now some kind of dirty-blond warrior for the planet, with hair that was dreadlocking itself, and army trousers that would not pass an inspection.",

The small-town pain specialist had always been known for his compassionate approach, but as opioid addiction rates climbed in the community, suspicions grew. A state medical board investigation revealed irregularities in his prescribing patterns, with an unusually high number of patients receiving powerful painkillers for extended periods. Despite Steiger's insistence that he was merely addressing chronic pain issues often overlooked by other doctors, the board ordered him to cease prescribing opioids pending further review. Steiger, a man in his late fifties with graying hair and tired eyes, found himself caught between his Hippocratic oath and a system increasingly wary of potential abuse. He maintained his innocence, arguing that the complexities of pain management were being oversimplified by bureaucrats who had never sat across from a patient in agony. As his practice dwindled and former patients sought care elsewhere, Steiger retreated into his modest home on the outskirts of town, poring over medical journals and patient files, determined to prove that his methods, while unorthodox, were rooted in genuine care for his patients' well-being. The once-respected doctor now walked a fine line between vindication and disgrace, his fate hanging in the balance of a medical system grappling with its own role in a growing crisis.",

Everybody knew him, everybody in the small town of Cormac, Arizona trusted him.

Steiger asked himself, every night, as he sat up sleepless, anxious at the thought of losing his job. But as his practice dwindled and former patients sought care elsewhere, Steiger retreated to a small home on the outskirts of town, poring over medical journals and patient files, determined to prove that his methods, while unorthodox, were rooted in genuine care for his patients' well-being. The once-respected doctor now walked a fine line between vindication and disgrace, his fate hanging in the balance of a medical system grappling with its own role in a growing crisis.",

Dr. Steiger fought back when he was indicted. “There is a vendetta against doctors who prescribe opioids regularly,” he said. “But me, I’m the aggressive type. I aggressively help my patients.

This time the feeling was different—that is, the starkness was there, the calmness was there also, but these clean, serene sensations were spiked with a sharp surprise, which quickly morphed to perplexity, and then to sorrow. She fit in a wisp of disappointment before the fall was through. Her eyes tearing, the lights of high-rises blurred. Above, the evening sky rippled into the infinite ocean that had waited to greet her for fourteen years: largely good years, really—gravy, a long and lucky reprieve. Then, of course, what had mattered was her body striking the line, and now what mattered was not striking it—and what were the chances of that? By the time she reached the sidewalk, Liana had taken back her surprise. At some point there was no almost. That had always been the message.

        "Human-Written": "In her dressing room there was a table with a three-way mirror. Grady, unclasping a bracelet chain, could see in the mirror every movement of Clyde’s in the other room. He undressed quickly, leaving his clothes wherever he happened to be; down to his shorts, he lighted a cigarette and stretched himself, the colors of sun reﬂecting along his body. Then, smiling toward her, he dropped his shorts and stood in the doorway: “You mean that? That I disgust you?” She shook her head slowly; and he said, “You bet you don’t,” while the mirror, jarred by the fall of her chair, shot through the dusk arrows of dazzle. ♦",
