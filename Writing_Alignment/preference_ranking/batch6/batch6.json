        "preedit": "As they stepped out of the police headquarters, Philip and his mother were met with a disorienting blast of sunlight, a harsh contrast to the fluorescent-lit interrogation rooms they'd inhabited for hours. The bright light made Philip's eyes water, but it was his mother's fragile grip on his arm that really caught his attention. Her fingers, usually so steady, now trembled like leaves, betraying the exhaustion and fear that had been building inside her. Philip felt a pang of guilt and helplessness, knowing he was the reason she'd been dragged into this ordeal. As they made their way down the steps, the sounds of the city – car horns, chatter, and wailing sirens – assaulted their ears, a jarring reminder of the world outside the sterile, windowless rooms. Philip's mother took a deep breath, her eyes scanning the surrounding streets as if reorienting herself with reality. Her gaze lingered on the people passing by, their faces a blur of indifference, before settling back on her son. For a moment, they just stood there, suspended in the chaos, searching for a sense of normalcy. The tension in Philip's chest began to ease as he realized they were finally free to leave, but the weight of the experience still lingered, like a shadow cast over their shoulders. His mother's grip on his arm tightened, a silent plea to hold on to each other, to find solace in their fragile bond. As they walked away from the police headquarters, the city's din receded, and Philip felt the silence between them grow, a heavy, unspoken understanding that their lives had been forever altered.",
        "postedit": "Walking out of the police headquarters, Philip and his mother were welcomed into the afternoon air by the gentle sun. They'd been inside for hours, the building like a concrete casket, airless, the light stark. He felt his mother's hand on his, and in the touch was her overwhelming love. She had believed him, trusted that the police had been wrong, and for this he felt grateful. As they made their way down the steps, the sounds of the city – car horns, chatter, and wailing sirens – felt like a reprieve. The world was out here, alive, waiting for him. He looked at the people walking, adults, children, all of them free. And now he was one of them again. For a moment, they just stood there, on the steps outside. The tension in Philip's chest slowly began to ease. His mother's grip on his arm tightened, her silently communicating what she'd always said out loud to him, \"I got you.\" Now he completely believed her. The NYPD had taken him, wanting to pin another person's crimes on him. But thanks to his mother's trust, he was back out, free.",

Robert sat in the back, on his lap a Prada box stolen from Becka’s closet, the boots replaced by this, this—Robert still had no proper name for the thing, though he had taken to calling it You, as in, “You hungry?,” which led to his feeding it applesauce, the spoon disappearing into that wound of a mouth and hitting against something hard, something that Robert chose not to investigate. But it seemed satisfied. “You like that, huh?” Robert said, wiping its chin. The unfortunate visuals had re-formed into a certain familiarity, a habituation that bordered on hope. Robert ditched the towel for a Rangers T-shirt pulled from the twins’ bureau—“You comfy now?”—and decided on a more practical means of conveyance, hence the Prada box. He had briefly debated leaving it in the house while he went to retrieve the car, but even a thing like this deserved responsible parenting.",

At first, he'd been fascinated by the peculiar trinkets and scraps of paper inside. Now they felt like a burden. He couldn't shake the feeling of responsibility for unraveling their mystery, for reuniting them with their rightful owner. As he walked, he found himself glancing down at the box, his fingers tapping impatiently. The fluttering edges of a torn photograph caught his eye and curiosity pricked at him. Who were the people in the torn photograph? The farther he walked, the more the box's contents were slowly taking over his mind, echoes of a life he'd never known, a life that was not his, yet somehow felt like his. He quickened his pace, the station's familiar signs and sounds were a welcome distraction from its insistent presence. Yet, even as he hastened towards his destination, Robert felt a growing sense of duty to the box's secrets."

This might be the frozen resistance—were he to look right at her and tell her he didn’t, she would keep the appointment and go. He knew this. Something in him, though, some terrible weakness or lack of values, could not tell her. It felt like a muscle he did not have. He didn’t know why; he just could not do it, or even pray to do it. She believed he was good, serious in his values. Part of him seemed willing to more or less just about lie to someone with that kind of faith and trust, and what did that make him? How could such a type of individual even pray? What it really felt like was a taste of the reality of what might be meant by Hell. Lane Dean had never believed in Hell as a lake of fire or a loving God consigning folks to a burning lake of fire—he knew in his heart this was not true. What he believed in was a living God of compassion and love and the possibility of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ through whom this love was enacted in human time. But sitting here beside this girl as unknown to him now as outer space, waiting for whatever she might say to unfreeze him, now he felt like he could see the edge or outline of what a real vision of Hell might be. It was of two great and terrible armies within himself, opposed and facing each other, silent. There would be battle but no victor. Or never a battle—the armies would stay like that, motionless, looking across at each other, and seeing therein something so different and alien from themselves that they could not understand, could not hear each other’s speech as even words or read anything from what their face looked like, frozen like that, opposed and uncomprehending, for all human time.

He introduced himself—Brian something—which forced the other side of the exchange, Willa giving her name with a wave. Now they were three: Andrew and Willa and Brian. Brian was in his late fifties, early sixties. Car salesman seemed a second career; Andrew imagined him once working outdoors. Comfortable in the elements. Capable. This Brian probably had grown children who could flee on their own in case of emergency—maybe when the Cascadia subduction zone finally fulfills its predicted catastrophe. Andrew wished he had never read that article. But no. Everyone in Portland had talked about the Really Big One, with its estimates of local apocalypse. Earthquake and tsunami. Liquefaction and inundation. All the horror running just below their feet. In ten years? In fifty years? The terminal math of those odds and percentages. How do you know when to run? And this was two years ago, when the world seemed more solid.",

I thought it was soulful of Brody to stay on after sunrise, still looking at whatever the vista was. Maybe I’d walk a little myself. I was looking for my baseball hat—everybody said you needed a hat here—but I couldn’t find our backpack. Not anywhere. Had I put my hat in my shoulder bag? My bag was on the floor, with its contents spilling out. My wallet was still there, right on top, and I could see immediately that the billfold was empty.",

I swung my legs over the side of the bed, feeling the soft carpet beneath my feet. I shuffled to the kitchen to start coffee, the aroma of freshly ground beans filling the air. As I waited for coffee to brew, I checked my phone for notifications, my gaze swept the screen with a mix of habit and anxiety. Then I noticed my bag, slumped against the wall, its contents spilling out like a defeated animal. My heart sank as I approached it, sense of unease growing in my stomach. I knelt down, my gaze swept the scattered items: my wallet, phone charger, and a crumpled up receipt from last night's dinner. I was staring at a puzzle, trying to piece together the events of the previous evening. The realization hit me like a cold shower: someone had gone through my bag, and I had no idea who or why. A shiver ran down my spine as I wondered what else they might have taken, what secrets they might have uncovered. A distant memory and I was left to pick up the pieces of my invaded personal space."

Then his wife got on the phone, asking to speak to my mother, and attacked her as if they were intimate, blaming my mother for allowing the affair to develop. She said that they had already chosen a wife for him in Calcutta, that he’d left for America with the understanding that he’d go back after he had finished his studies, and marry this girl. They had bought the neighboring flat in their building for Pranab and his betrothed, and it was sitting empty, waiting for his return. “We thought we could trust you, and yet you have betrayed us so deeply,” his mother said, taking out her anger on a stranger in a way she could not with her son. “Is this what happens to people in America?” For Pranab Kaku’s sake, my mother defended the engagement, telling his mother that Deborah was a polite girl from a decent family. Pranab Kaku’s parents pleaded with mine to talk him out of the engagement, but my father refused, deciding that it was not their place to get embroiled in a situation that had nothing to do with them. “We are not his parents,” he told my mother. “We can tell him they don’t approve but nothing more.” And so my parents told Pranab Kaku nothing about how his parents had berated them, and blamed them, and threatened to disown Pranab Kaku, only that they had refused to give him their blessing. In the face of this refusal, Pranab Kaku shrugged. “I don’t care. Not everyone can be as open-minded as you,” he told my parents. “Your blessing is blessing enough.”",

He tried to speak, to whisper his wife's name, but his tongue felt heavy, as if anesthetized by a dentist, or replaced by a cast-iron prosthetic. His jaw ached from the tension and repeated movement. Had he slept in a peculiar position? Was he still dreaming? The words refused to emerge, knotted stubbornly in his throat. Without an answer, the slow drip of anxiety leaked through his heaving chest . He threw off the covers, his legs trembling. The clock on the nightstand glowed with an otherworldly light, its digits taunting him with their clarity. 2:50 AM: Marcus's mind could only form half-thoughts and fragmented phrases. His lips could form the shapes of words, but no sound escaped. He rubbed his face but the fog only thickened, like morning condensation upon glass, obscuring any view outside. In the darkness, the strangeness of his own body terrified him. He was thoughtless, voiceless, forlorn... having lost authority even over his own flesh. ",

Her mother, once the rock of the family, became withdrawn and distant, her eyes sunken with grief. Heloise's younger brother, who had idolized their father, began acting out, seeking attention with misbehavior and tantrums. Heloise, trying to fill the void, took on more responsibilities, caring for her brother and helping with household chores. But as she shouldered the burden, she felt invisible, her own emotions and needs ignored. Her mother's silence was deafening, and Heloise began to wonder if she was to blame for the accident, if she could have somehow prevented it. The house, once filled with laughter and music, was now a tomb, where every creak of the floorboards seemed to echo with her father's absence. As the months dragged on, Heloise's relationships with her family members began to fray. She felt like she was losing her mother, too, as the woman she once knew disappeared behind a mask of sorrow. Her brother's acting out escalated, and Heloise found herself caught in the middle, torn between her love for him and her resentment of his behavior. The accident had created a rift, a chasm that seemed insurmountable, and Heloise felt lost, unsure of how to bridge the gap between her old life and this new, shattered reality.",

Her mother devoted herself to work, demanding that her bosses assign her every work trip that came up. Heloise's younger brother, who had idolized their father, took the same tact, burying himself in school work. Only Heloise faced her grief. She wept, organized her father's wardrobe, wrote to family and friends who had attended the funeral. The house, once filled with the noise of people full and alive, was now quiet. She took to playing classical music, Bach, Handel—her father's favorites. As the months dragged on, life turned easier to live, her grief not healed, but easier to live with. And then it happened: her mother getting up to leave for work on a Sunday morning and in the kitchen collapsing. Heloise had to lead her back to bed, where finally the woman started to weep. And her brother too, after his semester was over, with no more studying to do, forced to face what he'd been avoiding. Now, months after the accident, the three members of the family left could come together to properly grieve this loss they had suffered together.",

One of them was his lover, it turned out in the days and weeks after the crash, and the other one was his lover’s friend. He’d never even registered at the conference. Didn’t it seem strange, Heloise’s mother asked long afterward, in her creaky, surprised, lightly ironic voice, as if it only touched her curiosity, that the two lovebirds had taken a friend along with them for their tryst in Paris? The lover was also killed; her friend was seriously injured. Heloise’s mother, Angie, had found out some of these things when she rushed to be at her husband’s bedside in a hospital in France: he lived on for a few days after the accident, though he never recovered consciousness.",

Dinesh, the quiet, behind-the-scenes producer, was sipping on a lukewarm coffee, listening intently as the DJs discussed their latest on-air antics. That's when Rachel, the station's music director, casually mentioned a literary magazine she'd been reading, and how one of the short stories had really resonated with her. Dinesh's eyes lit up, and he shared his own thoughts on the author's use of metaphors and imagery to evoke a sense of longing and nostalgia. The room fell silent. They'd known Dinesh for months, but this was the first time they'd seen him as more than just the guy who worked the soundboard. As they probed him about his own writing, his reserved demeanor cracked, and a quiet confidence emerged. It was as if they'd stumbled upon a hidden frequency, one that only he knew existed. The way he spoke about words and stories revealed a quiet passion, witnessing a private passion, one that didn't need validation but was happy to share its beauty. The girls exchanged glances, their perceptions shifting like the subtle adjustment of the dial on a radio. They saw Dinesh in a new light, not as a mysterious or brooding figure, but as someone with a rich inner life. The room's atmosphere transformed, becoming more intimate. In that moment, Dinesh's status changed, not because he'd become someone new, but because they'd finally tuned in to the frequency he'd been broadcasting all along."

His strict discipline unsettlingly opposed my father's gentle nature, although he left when I was still young. My stepfather's demands influenced my routine like a drumbeat, persistent and rigorous. He taught me how to throw a punch, how to take a hit, and how to ensure I never had to back down.

This dichotomy made me realize that true power lies not in the ability to inflict harm, but in the capacity to absorb and transform pain.

He hates having to tell people that it doesn’t mean anything “in Indian.” He hates having to wear a nametag on his sweater at Model United Nations Day at school. He hates that his name is both absurd and obscure, that it has nothing to do with who he is, that it is neither Indian nor American but, of all things, Russian. He hates having to live with it, with a pet name turned good name, day after day, second after second. He hates seeing it on the brown-paper sleeve of the National Geographic subscription his parents got him for his birthday the year before, and seeing it perpetually listed in the high honor roll printed in the town’s newspaper. At times his name, an entity shapeless and weightless, manages nevertheless to distress him physically, like the scratchy tag of a shirt he has been forced permanently to wear. At times he wishes he could disguise it, shorten it somehow, the way the other Indian boy in his school, Jayadev, had got people to call him Jay. But Gogol, already short and catchy, resists mutation. Other boys his age have begun to court girls already, asking them to go to the movies or the pizza parlor, but he cannot imagine saying, “Hi, it’s Gogol” under potentially romantic circumstances. He cannot imagine this at all.",

I told her it was because I was self-conscious about my forehead, a insecurity that stemmed from years of bullying in school. She looked at me with those big, curious eyes and said, \"But auntie, your forehead is just a forehead. It's not that big of a deal.\" In that moment, something shifted inside of me. Her words weren't profound or earth-shattering, but they were unencumbered by the emotional baggage that I'd been carrying around for years. Children have a way of cutting through our defenses, don't they? They don't know how to tiptoe around our insecurities or sugarcoat the truth. And that's precisely what makes their perspectives so valuable. When we're willing to listen to them, they can help us see our past experiences through fresh eyes, untainted by the narratives we've constructed around them. They can ask the questions we're too afraid to ask ourselves, like \"What's the big deal?\" or \"Why are you still holding onto that?\" And in their innocence, they can help us confront the unresolved issues that still linger, even if it's just by acknowledging that they're still there. Of course, it's not always easy to hear their words, but that's what makes them so powerful.

My defenses had been cut clean through, and the conclusions I had previously come to seemed unreasonable now. My niece, like many children, had not been conditioned to tiptoe around insecurities or falsely appease others. This genuineness is what makes children's perspectives so valuable. When we listen earnestly to what they have to say, they can help us see with fresh eyes, untainted by popular constructed narratives. They can ask the questions we're too afraid to ask ourselves, like \"What's the big deal?\" or \"Why are you still holding onto that?\" In their innocence, they can help us confront the unresolved issues linger, even if simply by acknowledging that they're still there.

This humble dessert, typically served from street carts or markets, is a masterclass in balancing flavors and textures. The sweetness of ripe mango, often sourced from local farms, is the star of the show, but it's the supporting cast of ingredients that elevates the mangonada to iconic status. A sprinkle of spicy Tajín, a tangy drizzle of lime juice, and a pinch of salt all work in harmony to awaken the taste buds. The crunch of toasted coconut flakes or crushed peanuts adds a satisfying depth, while the creamy coolness of a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream provides a soothing respite from the sweltering temperatures. But what truly sets the mangonada apart is its ability to evoke a sense of nostalgia and community. On sweltering summer afternoons, families and friends gather around mangonada vendors, sharing laughter and stories as they savor each bite. It's a moment of collective indulgence, a fleeting escape from the hustle and bustle of daily life.

Also called chamangos, they can be made with any combination of mango sorbet, chopped fresh mango or mango purée, and may or may not be spiked, but they’ll always contain the salty, spicy and tangy flavors of Tajín and chamoy. Tajín, a chile-lime salt, is a delicious addition to sweet and savory foods alike. Its sister condiment, chamoy, is traditionally made from fermented fruit, salt, sugar and chiles. Depending on your location, you can find Tajín, chamoy and tamarind straws — their sour, chewy coating adds an extra tickle of tartness — at supermarkets or Latin American grocers; all three are available online.",

I rouse her with a light touch on her shoulder, allowing her to wake at her own pace. While she stretches and yawns, I prepare her breakfast tray: a slice of golden toast, a plate of scrambled eggs still steaming, and fresh fruit sliced in a colorful assortment. I've learned that the presentation of her meal can greatly impact her mood, so I take care to create a visually appealing spread. Next, I assist her with her medications, diligently sorting the pills into their respective compartments. Some of the caplets are rather large and tough to swallow; I hand her a room-temperature glass of water to help her wash them down. Eyelids still heavy with sleep, Margot relies on me to guide her through this daily ritual. As she takes her medication, I discreetly observe her movements in order to note any signs of stiffness or pain which would require an adapted regiment. I help her with her grooming routine next, gingerly brushing her hair and assisting with her bathing. We engage in quiet conversation throughout the morning, sharing highlights from the day before or nostalgic anecdotes from the past. My goal is to provide routine calm and normalcy at the start of her day; from the appearance of her breakfast to the supervision of her medication, I work to set a familiar and positive tone. From years of working together, I've become acutely attuned to her needs, anticipating and responding to almost imperceptible changes in her behavior and body language, from asymmetry in her sitting position to fluctuations in her willingness to talk. By the time we're finished, Margot's face is animated by an eager alertness. She takes a sip of her cooled tea and I see, in her eyes, her readiness to tackle the day ahead. ",

She always declared that she was starving and gave precise instructions as to what she wanted—Earl Grey tea and orange juice with triangles of buttered rye toast and honey—then ran out of appetite halfway through the first piece of toast. I sorted out her pills and watched to make sure she swallowed them, because she was full of private superstitions about her health; her doctors in their reports called her “this delightful elderly lady,” but she was skeptical of their strict instructions and carelessly forgot them. When I helped put in her hearing aids, she flinched and pulled her head away. “Ouch, Diane! Be careful, darling. Dickie was so gentle when he did them.” Her white hair was very fine and straight, and she wore it swept into a chignon, which I was allowed to pin, while she grimaced into the mirror as if I were skewering her. Then she put on her face, as she called it, sitting at her dressing table, attending with religious seriousness to making up that awful old woman in the reflection. Not that she was awful. Some beauties, it’s true, are simply extinguished as age descends, but the same old light was still shining in Margot, despite the drooping earlobes she loathed, the age spots, the tremulous pouting lower lip. These were part of her now, and the light shone through them. She’d kept the nervous fine line of her jaw, and the striking straight nose, and what the magazines call poise. People often thought she’d been a dancer.",

He was about to hang up, thinking the call had dropped, when a faint voice whispered, \"Wait, don't go.\" The words were desperate. He settled back into his chair, his curiosity piqued. The speaker, a woman he'd been chatting with about a potential business deal, took a shaky breath. \"I'm so sorry, Miles. I just... I needed someone to talk to.\" Her voice cracked, and Miles sensed a vulnerability. \"What's going on?\" he asked softly, his tone a gentle prod. \"My mom passed away last night. I was supposed to meet with you today, but... I don't know, it felt like something normal, something to distract me.\" His heart went out to her, and he listened. The woman's words spilled out in a torrent, a mix of grief and guilt. Miles listened, a steady anchor on the other end of the line, as the woman's pain poured out, and he felt the weight of their connection shift from a business transaction to a human moment."

        "AI-edited": "Here's the paragraph with formatting and grammatical issues corrected:The accusatory statement, scrawled on the worn stone walls of the ancient chapel, seemed to sear itself into Prunty's conscience like a branding iron. \"You, who claim to speak for the divine, how do you explain the perpetuity of darkness?\" it read. \"Why do the horrors of our past linger, refusing to be extinguished by the passage of time?\" The words dripped with a venomous skepticism, as if the author had been wounded by the very faith Prunty professed to uphold. The priest's eyes lingered on the phrase \"important events,\" wondering if the writer referred to the brutal suppression of the rebellion, or the more recent tragedy that had claimed the life of a young girl in the village. The statement was not a question, but an indictment, implying that Prunty's God was either impotent or complicit in the face of evil. As he stood there, the silence of the chapel seeming to close in around him, Prunty felt the weight of his own doubts and fears. He thought of the countless nights he had lain awake, grappling with the same questions, and the meager comfort his faith had offered. The statement was a mirror held up to his own soul, reflecting the darkness he had tried to keep at bay. And yet, even as he felt the sting of accusation, Prunty sensed a deeper pain behind the words, a pain that echoed his own."

But his heart went out of whack, and the doctors said that he had suffered a small heart attack. He spent two months with Albina at a sanatorium. The second time his heart acted up was when his son was implicated in a disgusting story: a gang rape in a student dormitory. Yura’s father had recently died, and there was no one up there to appeal to for help. Yura had to go to a lot of offices, asking for favors and humiliating himself. His son was saved: he got away with probation. But after those six months Yura had to start taking heart medication. Then the problem had gone away.",

On day two, venture to the Westside, where the laid-back, beachy vibe of Santa Monica and Venice Beach awaits. Begin at the Annenberg Community Beach House, a public beach club with stunning ocean views, and then cruise along the bike path to Venice, where the boardwalk's street performers and vendors add to the lively atmosphere. For lunch, grab a bite at Gjusta, an artisanal bakery and cafe in the Arts District, before exploring the nearby Hauser & Wirth gallery, which showcases innovative contemporary art. End the day with a cocktail at the stylish Hotel Erwin's rooftop bar, which offers breathtaking views of the coastline.

There’s no way to cover its vastness in a weekend — or without a car — but it’s possible to capture its romance by avoiding the 405-10 interchange and sticking to one part of town each day. In this guide, we go west to east and loop back to the middle. While downtown has yet to return to its 2019 energy, there are notable happenings in other neighborhoods, like the renovated Hammer Museum’s reopening in Westwood, and the burgeoning number of restaurants, bars and shops in Hollywood. Locals know the best spots are hiding in plain sight, and an appreciation for beloved classics and an openness to all that’s new define the City of Angels. Well, that and embracing the drives.",

Adam will say “I feel so dark sometimes” or “It’s like I see things sometimes . . . through a dark water.” Adam wants Fish to understand, but Fish isn’t interested, and, besides, he’ll call Adam on where he stole that dark-water part—“The Executioner’s Song,” his favorite book—and remind him of a hundred ways the two of them, Fish and Adam, are equal in this darkness bullshit. They’ve seen the same things, they have the same urges. Adam will concede this, and will begin apologizing for everything, and for too long. He’s too contrite, too docile.",
