The corner store where he'd bought his first pack of cigarettes came to mind, along with the guilt he'd felt hiding them from his mother.

Wes felt a pang of regret for the years he'd spent away, chasing a life he thought would be more fulfilling. Now, standing in his childhood home, he realized how much of himself he'd left behind. The snow continued to fall, covering the town in a blank white slate, as if offering Wes a chance to start anew in the place he'd once been so eager to leave.",

He remembered Christmas in Chicago, the houses with their elaborate lights strung all across the facades. He remembered running down, kicking snow, and avoiding his brother Michael's bullying. He recalled one particular winter carol, him alone in the church, seated at the back, with the lead singer's beautiful voice seemingly directed at him. Was that the same winter with the thieves? The winter with the two thieves who went from house to house, only Wes aware and nobody believing him. Wes paused. The memory was coming back to him. This happened, didn't it? The thieves only he had seen, watching them through the telescope his father had bought for him. The thieves he'd had to set a trap for... Wes laughed. He watched the snow continue to fall. It wasn't a memory. The thieves—it wasn't his memory. It was a movie, an old movie he'd seen as a kid. It was a movie that was coming back now, so real to him.",

As she made her way to the front door, Carrie felt a twinge of annoyance at the interruption, mixed with a sense of curiosity about who could be visiting at this hour. She peered through the peephole, surprised to see a familiar face - a face she hadn't seen in years. Carrie hesitated, her hand on the doorknob, wondering if she should pretend she wasn't home.

She strapped on her wristwatch and made her way to the front door. Through the curtained glass was the smiling face of her classmate Clara, her hair newly buzzed and dyed pink. Carrie hesitated. She held the doorknob, wondering if she could pretend she wasn't home. Inside the house was solitude, was peace, and to open the door was to disrupt it. But propriety had a hold on her. Or, like her mother would say, she was simply a people pleaser. As she opened the door, Clara was already talking, asking if Carrie had heard about the new drama going on among their cohort. At that moment, Carrie realized she didn't like her classmate much. The feeling was clear inside her: her solitude was better than this person's company.",

It might be her parents, back already from Sainsbury’s, or Paul, coming in from across the road, to look for another ball or to get a drink of water. When he ran in from his games, sometimes he drank straight from the tap in the kitchen, making a great show of his wild heat and thirst, cocking his head under the flow, letting the water soak his hair, his eyes rolling back as if he were delirious with physical effort. On her way out through the crooked archway, Carrie caught sight of her reflection in another mirror, above the Pembroke table in the hall, with its bowl of unmatched gloves left over from winter and its jug filled with silvery dried honesty. The outer front door stood open, as it always did in the daytime; the inner door was made of rippled glass. A man was leaning against the glass on the other side, his bulk blocking the light. He was peering inside through his cupped hands to see if anyone was at home.",

Then, in the electronics section, sitting alone in its display case with a shiny and sleek orange strap, was the Fitbit Inspire 3. It was perfect. I’d always wanted one.

But, since getting back, he’d spent every day at his office at the university, even though it wasn’t term time, saying that he needed absolute concentration to work on the book he was writing. Robyn didn’t seem to miss him. She looked bemused when Valerie called him her daddy, as if she hardly recognized him by that name; she’d been only three or four when he’d moved out. Valerie didn’t ask Gil what he’d talked about with his daughter on the long car journey: perhaps they’d driven the whole way in silence. Or perhaps he’d questioned Robyn about her mother, or ranted on about her, or talked about his work. Sometimes in the evenings he talked to Valerie for hours about university politics or other historians he envied or resented—or even about the Civil War or the Long Parliament or the idea of the state—without noticing that she wasn’t listening, that she was thinking about new curtains or counting the stitches in her knitting. He might have found fatherhood easier, Valerie thought, if his daughter had been pretty. Moodily, after Robyn had gone to bed, Gil wondered aloud whether she was even his. “Who knows, with the Great Whore of Marylebone putting it about like there’s no tomorrow? The child’s half feral. She doesn’t look anything like me. Is she normal? Do they even send her to school? I think she’s backward. A little bit simple, stunted. No surprise, growing up in that sink of iniquity. God only knows what she’s seen.”",

        "AI-edited": "Gil, a reserved bookstore owner, struggles to maintain a civil, if strained, relationship with his ex-wife Valerie, a high-powered attorney. Their divorce, finalized three years ago, left lingering tensions that surface during their interactions, like when Gil passive-aggressively comments on Valerie's busy schedule or when Valerie criticizes Gil's 'lack of ambition' concerning their teenage daughter, Robyn. While they try to be polite for Robyn's sake, they struggle to communicate openly. Valerie's ambition and Gil's contentment with a simpler life created a rift that ultimately proved insurmountable in their marriage. Valerie's late nights at the office and Gil's reluctance to attend her work functions led to heated arguments and cold silences. Robyn, perceptive and caught in the middle, has become adept at reading the subtle shifts in her parents' moods, from the tightening of her mother's jaw to the way her father's fingers drum nervously on the kitchen counter. She often finds herself mediating their different approaches to parenting, interpreting Gil's introverted musings for her mother and Valerie's assertive directives for her father. Despite their differences, both parents share a deep love for Robyn and a desire to shield her from their own conflicts. Valerie's success often overshadows Gil, making it difficult for him to assert his role as a parent, while Valerie grapples with guilt over her demanding work schedule. As Robyn grows older, she begins to form her own opinions about her parents' separation.",

Perhaps this was her idea of fun, and she'd emerge at any moment with a triumphant grin. But what if she was hurt, trapped, or worse? The beam of light trembled in my unsteady hand as my mind raced through countless scenarios, each more terrifying than the last. I took a deep breath, trying to channel my sister's courage. I knew my choice would change everything. The darkness seemed to watch, waiting for my move.",

Like someone flew a plane into your soul. Like someone flew two planes into your soul. Elvis sits shivah with you in the apartment; he pats you on the shoulder, tells you to take it easy. Four years earlier, Elvis had a Humvee blow up on him on a highway outside Baghdad. He was pinned under the burning wreckage for what felt like a week, so he knows a little about pain. His back and buttocks and right arm are so scarred up that even you, Mr. Hard Nose, can’t look at them. Breathe, he tells you. You breathe non-stop, like a marathon runner, but it doesn’t help. Your little letters become more and more pathetic. Please, you write. Please come back. You have dreams where she’s talking to you like in the old days—in that sweet Spanish of the Cibao, no sign of rage, of disappointment. And then you wake up.",

        "Human-Written": "One Saturday in September, on our way out the door to Point Reyes with the girls, we found a conversion van parked in front of Bing’s house. A man our age, forty or so, was there, helping Bing up into the back seat of the van. It was our first opportunity to say hello, so we loitered in our driveway as he braced his shoulder against her, rubbing her back very tenderly as she climbed, her entire body trembling. Trying not to watch, I set my eyes on the walker, which stood alone on the sidewalk. The man got Bing seated, helped buckle her in, then jogged over to introduce himself. As we talked, Bing smiled out at us, leaning forward to see through the van’s side door. His name was Henry, he said. He was Bing’s youngest; he’d grown up there in the house beside ours and now lived in Stateline, Nevada, where he was a rock climber. I thought he looked too put-together for that, with his unwrinkled golf shirt tucked into khaki shorts, but the van, I saw, was rugged and full of gear. In that Californian way, to which I was still becoming accustomed, Henry seemed authentically pleased to meet us. He wanted to know if I played tennis. There were courts behind the high school, and he had his racket in the van. He’d come home to take Bing to the doctor, but he’d be around all weekend. Henry was well built, in easy possession of his body; he carefully and politely divided his attention between Anna and me as he spoke. I declined, with regrets. I’m pretty sedentary, I said, except for walks in the woods, things like that. Sure, he said, no problem. When Anna called out to Bing to say that she’d raised a very nice son, Bing responded warmly in Chinese from the back of the van. Before we left, Henry asked if we might exchange numbers. His father had died last year, his brother lived in Denver and his sister in New York, and his mother was stubborn about her independence. It would be a comfort to know that there was someone just next door.",

        "AI-edited": "One Saturday in September, I was loading the car with snacks and sweaters for our trip to Point Reyes when Bing and her son Henry appeared at the end of the driveway. Bing looked frazzled; Henry clung to her hand, his eyes wide and curious. \"Hi there,\" she called out, sounding half-exhausted and half-relieved. My girls, already buckled in the backseat, fell silent, their chatter replaced by curious intrigue about the surprise visit. Bing explained that her car wouldn’t start and asked if we could give them a lift to the repair shop. I hesitated, caught between the day's plans and the unspoken rule of neighborly duty. Finally, I agreed, changing our day’s plans. We squeezed in, Henry wedged between my youngest and the cooler of sandwiches, a small interruption in our well-planned day. As we drove, Bing shared fragments of their morning—full of small mishaps but genuine. My girls watched Henry, who poked at his shoelaces, the car's motion bringing a quiet calm. We missed the turnoff for Point Reyes, but somehow, it didn't seem to matter all that much.",

So what should have taken me twenty minutes was going to take an hour and a half. Sitting in the back of the J-23B with the air-conditioning barely working, I stared out the window as we crawled through residential neighborhoods whose houses were all flying flags. There was no breeze, and the flags hung limply. Once in a while, there’d be a sign stuck in a window that said “Peace” or “No War,” or something to that effect, but for the most part everyone was on the same page. Ten minutes into the ride, I was sweating heavily; rivulets ran from my armpits down my sides and collected in the elastic of my underwear. This is what it must feel like for soldiers sitting on the transport, heading to battle, I thought. I was wearing shorts, and my thighs adhered to the bus seat, so that whenever I shifted my skin peeled away from the plastic. The other passengers were old hands and had come equipped with things to fan themselves with, like newspapers and magazines and even a flattened cereal box. I retrieved a discarded supermarket circular from under the seat in front of me and tried to use it, but the paper was too thin and kept flopping over, so I wasn’t able to generate any current. I folded it four times, and then four more times, and then gave up and tossed it back under the seat where I’d found it. A woman looked at me with accusation. She was waving a library book in front of her face.",

        "Human-Written": "This is how it happened. On a humid Monday, four cult members waited at the campus gate and waylaid a professor driving a red Mercedes. They pressed a gun to her head, shoved her out of the car, and drove it to the Faculty of Engineering, where they shot three boys who were coming out of the building. It was noon. I was in a class nearby, and when we heard the shots our lecturer was the first to run out the door. There was loud screaming, and suddenly the stairwells were packed with scrambling students unsure where to run. Outside, the bodies lay on the lawn. The Mercedes had already screeched away. Many students hastily packed their bags, and okada drivers charged twice the usual fare to take them to the motor park to get on a bus. The vice-chancellor announced that all evening classes would be cancelled and everyone had to stay indoors after 9 P.M. This did not make much sense to me, since the shooting had happened in sparkling daylight, and perhaps it did not make sense to Nnamabia, either, because the first night of the curfew he didn’t come home. I assumed that he had spent the night at a friend’s; he did not always come home anyway. But the next morning a security man came to tell my parents that Nnamabia had been arrested at a bar with some cult boys and was at the police station. My mother screamed, “Ekwuzikwana! Don’t say that!” My father calmly thanked the security man. We drove to the police station in town, and there a constable chewing on the tip of a dirty pen said, “You mean those cult boys arrested last night? They have been taken to Enugu. Very serious case! We must stop this cult business once and for all!”",

Minutes later, chaos erupted as the group revealed weapons, causing panicked screams to fill the building. Campus police responded swiftly but were overwhelmed. In the aftermath, three students lay dead, and dozens were injured. In the days that followed, the university community was in shock. Classes were canceled as investigators combed the scene. Candlelight vigils were held nightly, the flickering flames illuminating tear-stained faces as students huddled together, seeking solace in shared grief. The cult members, it emerged, were former students radicalized online. Their manifesto, found later, revealed a tangled ideology of academic elitism and apocalyptic fervor. They believed only the intellectual elite should survive the coming end times and sought to purge those they deemed unworthy from the university. The community mourned. People were afraid. Difficult questions arose about free speech, mental health resources, and the university's responsibility to monitor fringe groups. Some students transferred out, unable to feel safe. Others formed support groups and pushed for reforms. The incident forced the university to confront long-ignored issues on campus.",

Originating from Vietnam, this sandwich beautifully melds cultural influences, with a crusty baguette as its vessel. It's the democratization of ingredients that sets the bánh mì apart. Whether it’s the succulent pork belly, delicate pâté, or tangy pickled vegetables, each component is chosen for balance, ensuring that no single element overpowers the others. This adaptability speaks to its versatility, accommodating a diverse range of palates and dietary preferences without losing its essence. You can find bánh mì bursting with traditional meats or completely plant-based, and both versions will retain the sandwich’s hallmark crisp-tender texture and layered flavors. This flexibility also makes bánh mì a blank canvas, inviting each vendor to add a personal touch, leading to a culinary experience that feels both universal and hyper-local.

        "Human-Written": "Bánh mì are, frankly, perfect sandwiches. From the baguettes (“bánh mì” literally translates to bread) to the fillings, they leave room for endless variation while remaining entirely distinct as a complete, complex Vietnamese dish. For this recipe, pork is the star: Following a brief marinade, the meat is broiled, then stuffed in a warm baguette alongside pickles, mayo, butter and a sprinkling of herbs. Ideally, it’s worth picking up the baguettes and butter from your local Vietnamese bakery or bánh mì shop (just ask; they’ll likely sell some to you). Both the pork and the pickles can be made ahead of time. Any extra cooked pork shoulder would serve as delicious leftovers when reheated alongside rice and eggs, or tossed between noodles, or folded into yet another bánh mì. Any extra pickles will hold in the fridge for several weeks — and are endlessly adaptable for later meals.",

The breakfast room had mosaicked walls with glittering pink flamingoes and purple turtles. The guests were around our age, some of them newlyweds, others with kids just as young.

I am a man travelling with bitter enemies who happen to be his most intimate family. It’s become Greek, or something worse. A roly-poly concierge emerges from an archway of bougainvillea, pushing a wheelbarrow and clenching a flashlight between his teeth. He’s very glad to see us, he says, once he has spit the flashlight out, his warm smile landing on our sorry faces. He informs us that the owners have gone to bed. They had stayed up waiting for us, but it got too late. He has the key, though, and will show us to our rooms. He stacks our luggage on the wheelbarrow, bites down on the flashlight again, and we all follow him down the twisting stone path. Wind generators on tall metal poles are humming and flapping like exotic birds. The constant wind off the Caribbean is tearing at the palms, forcing them into a savage dance. I have this strange wish, as we follow the bobbing beam of the flashlight, that we were all different people—strangers just happening to come together in the night. How much happier we might be if we didn’t know each other at all. No history. No remorse. Daybreak. The wind has calmed and the sea is flat and smooth clear to the horizon. The giant red sun presses up against the distant arc of the earth. How far away is the rest of the world? I’m the first one awake and happy to be alone on the beach. Tiny white crabs skitter into their holes at my approach. A string of sandpipers hurries ahead of me, darting in and out of the quiet surf. Above, the frigate bird soars. Turning back in the direction of the ancient Mayan ruins, I see the couple from St. Paul staring silently at the rising sun, the woman holding her vigil behind the wheelchair exactly as she did at the airport. The man, in dark glasses, sits erect with his hat in his lap, both hands holding the brim. As the monster sun mounts, the couple turns rosy red, then slowly bright orange, as though they might suddenly burst into flame, then crumble in ash to the sand. Neither of them moves an inch; they are frozen in the burning light. They have finally arrived. My daughter slips up beside me, still half asleep, in sweatpants and a T-shirt with Bob Marley’s face screaming across her chest.",

        "Human-Written": "Henry’s family had tried to arrange for a private cell, but none were available. He knew that he should be grateful for what he had—many others were in far worse conditions—but, under the circumstances, he found it difficult to muster much gratitude. For the first few days, he hardly stirred. He didn’t register Rogelio’s face, and he knew nothing of his new home, beyond what he’d managed to glean during that initial terrifying walk. Henry was given the top bunk, and for three days he slept long hours, or pretended to sleep, facing the wall. Thinking. Remembering. Trying to disappear. He didn’t eat, but felt no hunger. The night of his arrest had been catalogued in his mind, divided into an infinite series of micro-events: he remembered each flubbed line of the performance, the expressions on the faces of the audience members who’d expected and hoped for better. Could any of those details be shifted slightly—just enough to alter the outcome? Was there a light revision he could make to that evening’s script so that it would not end with him here, in Collectors?",

        "AI-edited": "Henry's initial days in the facility were marked by a strange, suffocating quiet. The sterile white walls, unadorned and clinical, seemed to suck the life out of the very air, making the vibrant world outside feel like a distant, faded photograph. The elderly residents, all pallid and withdrawn, moved silently like phantoms, their faces devoid of life or individuality. Henry wondered if he, too, looked that way. He couldn't shake the persistent hollowness in his chest. The nights were the worst when the silence thickened, and memories resurfaced. He kept to himself, hoping to remain unnoticed and avoid the complex social dynamics of his new surroundings. Each day blurred into the next as he studied the staff's trained yet empty smiles, thinking back on the last time he genuinely laughed. He couldn't remember. Henry questioned how long this would persist. Every step he took reminded him of his loss but also carried a faint, almost imperceptible promise that somewhere, within this maze of uncertainty, there could be a path to something more.",

The sky, fading from apricot to indigo, breathed whispers of unsaid words through the rustling leaves. I pulled out my phone and began speaking, my voice tiny and quivering in the vast twilight.

The sky was fading into dark, and all around me was the sound of rustling leaves. I pulled out my phone, switched it to Do Not Disturb to keep the noisy world at bay, and began speaking, even my voice disrupting the peace of the twilight. It all came to me: work deadlines, reports, my daughter's awkward laugh, my father's silence; there was no hierarchy to the thoughts, all of them taking equal importance, all of them making one life. Recording them felt like stitching fragments of who I was, and who I feared to become, into a single tenuous thread. The shadows of the trees were fading along with the light. What is here for a hundred years, in one moment it could all disappear. My words quieted into the mellow dusk, and the smell of the earth, the leaves fallen off the trees, began to rise. My phone returned to my pocket, and I faced the world in front of me.",

        "Human-Written": "Walking at dusk through the long meadow, recording this prose poem on my phone, that’s my job, as old as soldiery, the hills, the soldered hills where current flows, green current. When you are finished recording, your lips are dried flowers. The trees are full of black plastic bags and hornets’ nests but not significance; the task of imbuing them falls to me. And it’s me, Ben, just calling to check in. I’m on the way to pick Marcela up from day care and just wanted to hear about your trip. I’m sure it must have been hard seeing him like that. Anyway, I love you and I’m here. Give me a call when you can. I’ll be around until the late nineteenth century, when carved wood gives way to polished steel, especially in lake surfaces. You know how you sometimes realize it has been raining only when it stops, silence falling on the roof, forming rivulets on the glass? This is the religious equivalent of that, especially in music and applied fields, long meadows. Overwintering queens make wonderful pets, just don’t expect them to understand your writing, how you’ve rearranged the stresses to sponsor feelings in advance of the collective subject who might feel them, good work if you can get it, and you can’t, nobody can, that’s why the discipline is in crisis, this cut-flower business, applied folds, false equivalence. I remember when I interviewed for this position. I was wearing a Regency trimmed velvet tailcoat with a small hole over the left breast where the lead ball had entered one of my great-grandfather’s five heartlike structures. I met the committee at a Hyatt. The room had migraine carpet; a conventional river scene hung above the bed. After the usual pleasantries, the chairperson requested that I sing, and soon the painted water began to flow. It’s hard to believe that was more than two hundred years ago, when people still got dressed up for air travel and children were expected to absorb light in their super-black feathers, making contour disappear. They probably evolved to startle predators, make us seem deep, so that, when they least expected it, we could cast their underground nests with molten aluminum, sell them online as sculpture. But if you’ve ever seen a dendritic pattern in a frozen pond, lightning captured in hard plastic, or the delicate venation of an insect’s wing (the fourth vein of the wing is called the media), then you’ve probably felt that a spirit is at work in the world, or was, and that making it visible is the artist’s task, or was. I am resolved to admire all elaborate silvery pathways, no matter where I find them, that’s why I’m calling. I’m sitting in Grand Army Plaza by the fountain, which they’ve shut off until the spring, when it will again give sensuous expression to our freedom. In other words, I’m at work, realigning and interlocking barbules, lubricating what are essentially dead structures with a fatty oil I’ve developed for that purpose, thinking of you, holding you in my thoughts like fireflies in glass, cold to the touch, green current. You just can’t blame yourself. The last time I saw him we had dinner in Fort Greene and he was cracking me up with his impressions, especially of John. He was drinking, but not too much: one cocktail, white wine. The only weird moment was when I had to look at my phone because I was getting a lot of texts and wanted to make sure everything was O.K. with the girls. He kind of freaked out about it: Am I boring you? Do you need to make a call? But I apologized and we moved on. What reassured me most was how excited he was about the new job, even if it didn’t pay much. They were going to let him use the 3-D printers for some of his own stuff and he was really psyched about that. Anyway, I love you and I’m here. I’ve got to get Marcela now but tonight I’m around, promoting syllables, trying to avoid the twin traps of mere procedure and sentimentalism, ingesting around seventeen milligrams, blunt-toothed leaves in motion lights, signifying nothing but holding a place. Lately my daughters have been asking what I do when they’re at school; I want to say that I enchant the ferryman with my playing so that lost pets may return, that the magnet tiles arrange themselves into complex hexagonal structures at my song, but they know I’m not the musical one, that I describe the music of others, capture it in hard plastic. With the profits, I purchase an entrapping foam that coats the nest for a complete kill and a pendant that resembles a tiny abacus of pearls, responsibly sourced. What does a normal day look like for you? For me, the fruit is undefined around the edges and the faces of some friends are mere suggestions while others observe the standard codes of verisimilitude in a way that feels increasingly affected; why appear vividly when it’s dusk, has been dusk for ages? I don’t know if oysters can feel pain, can’t even know if other humans do, although I recognize what philosophers call “pain behavior” among my loved ones as the seasons change. Tie their stems together with unflavored dental floss and hang them upside down, but display them away from windows or they’ll fade, polished steel gives way to painted water, a turn of phase, a change of phrase, the slippages release small energy and the harvest falls to me. Someday I’d like to bring my daughters to work, but not today. Today is cut-glass flowers reinforced internally with wire, a vibration-control system, the religious equivalent of that, lampwork they’re too young to understand, the effects too mild. Their nests are paper, they can discriminate between fragments of foreign and natal comb, the interests between workers and their queen diverge, those are the three prerequisites for song, for the formation of singers who will eat both meat and nectar, which they feed to larvae on the bus ride home. Marcela pulls the yellow stop-request cord, but never hard enough, so you have to help without her knowing, say “Great job.” Say “Great job” to the sensible world if you want to encourage reënchantment, keep the trees in touch with their strengths, the magnolia’s increasing northern range, for instance, soon to be cold-hardy beyond zone four. The way we say of our children “they went down” to mean they fell asleep, that makes me glass, soft glass bending in long meadows, a fallacy each generation reinvents and disavows, reinvents and disavows, a rocking motion. Otherwise you’re mixing pills and gin and your friends are debating whether it constitutes a true attempt, recklessness, a cry for help, before deciding it makes no difference, it’s pain behavior, he has to be checked in, monitored, sponsored, set to music. Anyway, the girls are down and I can talk. I’m just clicking on things in bed, a review by a man named Baskin, who says I have no feelings and hate art. Through the blinds I can see the blue tip of the neighbor’s vape pen signalling in the dark, cold firefly. The raccoons are descending from their nests in foreclosed attics to roam the streets of Kensington; we moved last summer, have a guest room now, come visit. I can’t believe I haven’t seen you since his wedding. ♦",

Tony helped us gather, mother up pairs, and separate bulls, and he lived in the house for many a good year and kept us entertained with all his tricks. Finally, Tony grew old and died. We didn’t take it so good, especially the old sumbitch, who said he couldn’t foresee enough summers for another dog. Plus that was the year he couldn’t get on a horse no more and he wasn’t about to work no stock dog afoot. There was still plenty to do and most of it fell to me.

Training him was more like bonding through mutual understanding. We navigated the field together, him learning the subtleties of my whistles and gestures, and me impressed by his quick learning and sharp instincts. Gradually, Tony became indispensable, demonstrating an uncanny understanding of the herd's movements. During the long, hot summers and biting winters, his presence was a constant that I could rely on. When work was especially tough, a pat on his head made things seem a bit easier. The years went by, but his spirit never dimmed. The day he passed, quietly under the old oak tree, there was a palpable emptiness throughout the ranch.

He is the oldest and the wisest, with a wife and children. And there—there’s the sister who lives in London, who smiles like a movie star. And there’s the airline pilot. The girl knew that one of her brothers was an airline pilot who flew back and forth across the Atlantic every week. He was the tallest of them all—she knew it was him the minute she laid eyes on him—he turned around in the yard and when he caught sight of her he set down his suitcase and opened his arms, he was treetop tall and slim and the best-looking man she had ever seen, and she had, despite her tender years, seen lots, and she ran toward him and he swept her so high off the ground and swung her around so fast that she nearly lost her breath, but instead of losing her breath she opened her eyes, slowly, as if she were underwater, and from up there in his arms she saw not only Hammars, with its moors, its lambs, and its old limestone farmhouses, but the whole of Fårö, from the limestone quarry up at Norsholmen and the English cemetery south of Dämba to the sand dunes at Ullahau, where the girl had heard that you could go sledding in the winter, to the old grocery store down by the church and the beaches at Sudersand, Ekeviken, and Norsta Aurar, and all the way out to the sea stacks at Langhammars and Digerhuvud, and just when she thought he was going to set her down on the ground again his arms grew even longer and she rose even higher in the air and now she could see the ocean and the horizon and the Iron Curtain there in the distance, where, if you lose your way and end up there, they’ll never let you out.",

My mind raced with anxieties about tomorrow. Tonight, though, the difference felt more pronounced than ever. As I tossed and turned, I was more aware of how restless I felt. I considered waking him, longing for company in my sleepless state, but hesitated. I didn't want to disturb him. Instead, I slipped out of bed, careful not to disturb the mattress. In the kitchen, I poured a glass of water, trying to calm my racing thoughts. It didn't work. Frustrated, I returned to the bedroom, where Aiden had shifted in his sleep, one arm now stretched across my empty side of the bed. I paused in the doorway, suddenly reluctant to reclaim my place. I wondered if our different sleeping habits meant something more. But as I watched Aiden's chest rise and fall, I felt calm. I crawled back into bed and listened to his breathing.",
