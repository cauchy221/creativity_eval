In any case, the teen mingled into the bodies and was lost. The crowd, loose at the outset, seemed to be growing denser. Was this happening only in the side room he’d entered? Perhaps it had grown crowded with those like R., who’d felt curious to see what it held. It appeared as though at the far end of the side room it opened to another enormous indoor space, one perhaps as without boundary as the one that R. had just left. Yet the density of bodies in the current room made it unappealing to attempt to cross. So R. turned back toward the large room from which he’d come, seeking free space.",

In these quiet moments, she understood that her feelings about Greg's new relationship were more complicated than she had realized. It wasn't jealousy but a bittersweet clarity. Seeing him with someone else had pulled into focus the charade they had been living before their split. Her irritation now seemed misplaced, a distraction from the quieter truth that the end of their relationship had always been inescapable, perhaps even overdue. Debra realized Greg's patterns might never change. This brought her an odd solace, though it was laced with a touch of heaviness. She had been mourning an illusion rather than an actual loss, freeing her from past grievances. Debra felt lighter, more herself than she had in months. She closed her eyes, breathing in newfound peace.",

There had been so many times in the past when he had feared that this would happen, so many moments that had become one single blur of panic, and now it felt like the dull echo of an aftermath. Cleotilde flung herself on the ground and began to cry. She may never have visited her father’s country, but he was convinced at that moment of her Africanness; how else would she have been able to fling herself to the ground with that perfect dramatic flourish? He wondered if her tears were for him or for herself, or for what might have been between them. She had no need to worry; the policemen barely glanced at her. It was he who felt the heaviness of the handcuffs during the drive to the police station, he who silently handed over his watch and his belt and his wallet and his phone.

His coworkers noticed he was more focused and less prone to small talk. He found himself spending more time in the breakroom, nursing a cup of coffee, lost in thought.

She feels uneasy, not fully belonging to either world. The students she sees appear carefree and full of potential. Their laughter drifts through the air, but Joanie's gaze lingers on the small details that hint at their privilege—designer backpacks, shiny bicycles, and expensive sneakers. As she walks further away from the university, she relaxes. She finds comfort in familiar sights of children playing on cracked sidewalks and elderly neighbors tending to small garden plots. Joanie feels conflicted; she envies the students' opportunities but appreciates the authenticity of her own neighborhood. She recognizes the invisible barriers between their worlds.",

The main thing is to avoid having to deal with anybody, which turns out to be easier than she thought it would be. After a couple of days she’s kind of stir-crazy. When she isn’t slogging through “A Tale of Two Cities,” she keeps her earbuds in and texts with Lexie, or sometimes with Evan, who’s this boy from school. She’s hung out with Evan a few times, and once, at a party, in an upstairs bathroom, let him get to second base. Under the shirt but over the bra. But lately this girl, Jenna, who goes to private school, is all over his Instagram. Not like in pictures with him, just hearting every single post and sometimes leaving “first!” as a comment, which for Jenna’s own sake Charity hopes is irony, but who can say. Lexie thinks Evan is a loser, which yeah maybe, but he’s funny and easy to be around, so if he texts her she usually texts him back, sometimes right away and sometimes after waiting some random amount of time. And sometimes, like right now, she texts him first. “My grams is losing it. All she does is clean the same clean shit. She’s like bleaching bleach.”",

        "preedit": "Nachman's epiphany about the primacy of memories over photographs came gradually, sparked by a series of seemingly mundane events. It began with the discovery of an old, faded photograph of his grandmother tucked away in a drawer. As he held the image, he realized he couldn't recall the sound of her voice or the way her hand felt in his. The photograph, once a cherished memento, now felt like a pale imitation of the real woman. In the days that followed, Nachman found himself drawn to other photographs, both his own and those of strangers in magazines and online. He studied the faces, searching for clues to their inner lives, but the images remained stubbornly silent. It was during a chance encounter with a street musician that the pieces finally fell into place. The old man's weathered face and calloused fingers told a story that no photograph could capture. In that moment, Nachman understood that his own identity was not a static image, but a living, breathing thing, shaped by the accumulation of moments and memories. He saw himself as a product of induction, his present self-built upon the foundation of his past experiences. At the same time, he recognized the power of analogy, the way his own story was woven into the larger tapestry of human experience.

He couldn't recall the sound of her voice or the way her hand felt in his. The photograph felt like a pale imitation of the real woman. In the days that followed, Nachman found himself drawn to other photographs, both his own and those of strangers in magazines and online. He studied the faces, searching for clues to their inner lives. The images remained stubbornly silent. Walking along a city block, around the corner from his house, Nachman came across a street musician playing a guitar. The old man's weathered face and calloused fingers told a story that no photograph could capture. In that moment, Nachman understood that his own identity was not a static image but a living, breathing thing, shaped by the accumulation of moments and memories. The old man's life could not have been easy, performing on the street after so many years, and clearly, he was talented. Nachman could see so many lives just in the man's knuckles, in the way his head nodded slightly as he played. Every life was a tapestry, Nachman thought, stitched together by many lives and connected to every other life around it. The old man stopped playing. He gestured toward the box in front of him.",

A young barefoot girl stood under the tree of life with a dove on one arm, and I swear she looked just like Starling.

        "Human-Written": "In the end, my mother was right, and fourteen years after that Thanksgiving, after twenty-three years of marriage, Pranab Kaku and Deborah got divorced. It was he who had strayed, falling in love with a married Bengali woman, destroying two families in the process. The other woman was someone my parents knew, though not very well. Deborah was in her forties by then, Bonny and Sara away at college. In her shock and grief, it was my mother whom Deborah turned to, calling and weeping into the phone. Somehow, through all the years, she had continued to regard us as quasi in-laws, sending flowers when my grandparents died, and giving me a compact edition of the O.E.D. as a college-graduation present. “You knew him so well. How could he do something like this?” Deborah asked my mother. And then, “Did you know anything about it?” My mother answered truthfully that she did not. Their hearts had been broken by the same man, only my mother’s had long ago mended, and in an odd way, as my parents approached their old age, she and my father had grown fond of each other, out of habit if nothing else. I believe my absence from the house, once I left for college, had something to do with this, because over the years, when I visited, I noticed a warmth between my parents that had not been there before, a quiet teasing, a solidarity, a concern when one of them fell ill. My mother and I had also made peace; she had accepted the fact that I was not only her daughter but a child of America as well. Slowly, she accepted that I dated one American man, and then another, and then yet another, that I slept with them, and even that I lived with one though we were not married. She welcomed my boyfriends into our home and when things didn’t work out she told me I would find someone better. After years of being idle, she decided, when she turned fifty, to get a degree in library science at a nearby university.",

When he met Deborah, a lively American woman, my mother was cautiously optimistic but apprehensive. As their romance blossomed, their divergent upbringings became starkly apparent. Deborah's free-spirited American lifestyle, marked by spontaneous road trips and casual dinners at trendy restaurants, clashed with our deeply rooted Bengali traditions of elaborate family gatherings and meticulous rituals. My mother, always the silent supporter, watched with a mixture of hope and unease as Pranab Kaku married Deborah, which changed our family dynamics. Over time, what initially appeared to be an embrace of new culture turned into a gradual drift away from old ties. My mother's subdued disapproval of the cultural compromises Pranab made began to create an unspoken strain. She was a traditionalist at heart, and as Pranab and Deborah's carefree lifestyle highlighted our conventional rigidity, her belief in the sanctity of familial duty and cultural identity began to fracture. Family gatherings happened less often, calls became more awkward. Pranab Kaku's visits dwindled, and with each absence, the gap between him and our family widened.

From up on the interstate, the spectacle of modern, Southern city life and ambitious new construction where once had been a low, genteel old river city seemed particularly gruesome and unpromising and probably seemed the same to Sallie. To me, who labored in one of the tall, metal-and-glass enormities (I could actually see my office windows in Place St. Charles, small, undistinguished rectangles shining high up among countless others), it felt particularly alien to history and to my own temperament. Behind these square mirrored windows, human beings were writing and discussing and preparing cases; and on other floors were performing biopsies, CAT scans, drilling out cavities, delivering news both welcome and unwelcome to all sorts of other expectants—clients, patients, partners, spouses, children. People were in fact there waiting for me to arrive that very afternoon, anticipating news of the Brownlow-Maisonette case—where were things, how were our prospects developing, what was my over-all take on matters, and what were our hopes for a settlement (most of my \"take\" wouldn't be all that promising). In no time I'd be entering their joyless company and would've forgotten about myself here on the highway, peering out in near despair because of the fate of an insignificant little dog.

The floorboards felt cool against her bare feet. Mr. Whiskers, her tabby, chirped a greeting and wound between her ankles as she shuffled towards the kitchen. The faucet's stream filled her glass, the water's coolness momentarily soothing her parched throat. A dull thudding penetrated the walls, growing louder with each beat. Mrs. Kowalski's TV again, Sarah realized with a sigh. The noise seemed to reverberate inside her skull, making coherent thought impossible. She leaned against the counter, fingers drumming an unconscious counter-rhythm. Mr. Whiskers meowed, pawing at the treat jar. Sarah obliged, the dry kibble clattering into his bowl. As she watched him eat, Sarah found herself swaying to the muffled bass. Her irritation slowly morphed into a strange, disconnected calm. She returned to bed, leaving the glass half-full on the nightstand. As she drifted off, the persistent thudding merged with her heartbeat, an oddly comforting lullaby in the pre-dawn quiet.",

        "Human-Written": "She eases herself off the bed and stands up. The cat watches her. She is stiff and her mouth is dry and she thinks she will brush her teeth and find her earplugs. When she turns to leave the cat makes a furious protest, and then leaps out to join her. She walks along the corridor in the gloom, not daring to turn on any lights, to the bathroom, wary of the wall, imagining that it is bulging with sound, like the skin of a drum, though of course it is doing nothing of the sort. But this is so loud. She is still half asleep, and she knows that she is, but this is so loud, this is not what she had expected, surely it can’t be this loud? The cat is mewling behind her, following her all the way into the bathroom—no rules tonight, bauble—and she splashes her face and brushes her teeth and rummages in the drawer for her earplugs, which are many years old, and all the while there is the throb of next door at her back, a boom and press of bass, like a heat against the wall, like a fire, and sometimes the haze, the flick of other things on top of it, singing and instruments and melody, things jumping and spitting on a pan. And the voices, all the voices boiling together, people having to shout to make themselves heard, shouting out, and you might think they’re dying in there if it was not for the laughter, the huge bursts of laughter that come every few seconds, which punch through the wall as if directed at her personally. She stands in the bathroom staring astonished at her own face in the mirror and just listens. The cat at her legs.",
