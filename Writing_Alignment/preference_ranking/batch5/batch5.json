This was a small and pristine forest where some older boys swore they’d seen an ivory-billed woodpecker, supposedly extinct for longer than the boys’ parents had been alive. But the boys’ parents seemed to think nothing of their trespassing in Mr. Chandler’s woods. If they knew that Chandler hated the boys being in there, they showed no sign. Chandler sometimes used his shotgun when he detected the boys’ presence in his woods, striding into his great back yard and firing off loads of bird shot that pecked down through the broad low canopy of leaves like a shower of rain. Once the middle McGowen brother took a pellet on the pad of his pinkie finger. The finger stayed swollen for a week. His older brother advised him to say it was a bee sting.",

The shock of the cold water hit her system, and for a moment, her friends feared for her safety. But as Sarah surfaced, laughing and gasping, something shifted in the group's dynamic. One by one, they joined her, each experiencing a personal revelation in the icy current. For some, it was a confrontation with long-held fears; for others, a rediscovery of childlike joy. The act of swimming in the cold river became a yearly tradition, marking the passage of time and personal growth. As they aged, got married, and had children, the river swim evolved into a rite of passage for their families. The once-hesitant group became known in their community for their resilience and zest for life, all stemming from that single, impulsive dive.

They had talked about swimming in it for years but always found excuses not to. This time, Sarah, usually the most cautious of the group, surprised everyone by suddenly diving in. The frigid water was paralyzing for a moment. She froze in shock, and her friends on land were briefly terrified. But as Sarah surfaced, laughing and gasping, something shifted in the group's dynamic. Sarah was the pioneer. They each took turns diving in, and the ice-cold water brought them to themselves in a new way. Some realized the fears they carried with them weren't as unmanageable as they believed. Others remembered the happiness they'd always had in childhood through discovery, through realizing there was always the possibility of something new around the corner of life. Newly emboldened, they agreed to do it again, year after year, a ritual that marked time's passing. As they aged, got married, and had children, the river swim evolved into a rite of passage for their families. The consequences of that first dive would resonate through the years. The shy, ginger youths became bold and resilient members of their community for the rest of their lives. Hearing something of this, Sarah's granddaughter asked for the rest of the story. She wanted to better understand how, through bravery, she too could shape the trajectory of her own life.",

We didn't exchange numbers, but I saw her again two weeks later at the same bar, a coincidence that suggested destiny. We talked, this time about the unhealthy allure of nostalgia. Our dates weren't polished affairs; they included walks through crowded markets, debates over film endings, and shared laughter over the absurdities of daily life. Three months in, I realized that with her, everything chaotic felt right. The proposal was almost a natural progression; we'd built our connection through the simple, messy moments of daily life.

But that night, at a bar, I met the woman who would become my best friend and business partner. We swapped stories of workplace humiliation, laughing until our sides hurt. She'd been fired for accidentally sending a company-wide email detailing her boss's toupee mishap. We toasted to our newfound unemployment until the bartender kicked us out at 2 AM, and by morning, we had the bones of a business plan sketched out on cocktail napkins. That moment changed everything. Sometimes, feeling lost leads to unexpected opportunities. It's not that the pain wasn't real—it absolutely was. But pain can open us up to new possibilities. So next time disaster strikes, take a deep breath. You never know what might come next.",

However, when the white family attempts to enter the valley, it reveals itself to be a spatial anomaly—a strip of ground between two fences which is too small to enter. Or, more strangely, when outsiders, such as the white family, insist on entering it, it shrinks and flattens them to fit. Lafferty’s story, originally published in 1966, still has much to recommend it: a delightful insouciance; admirable ethics (even if expressed in twentieth-century terms); surrealist humor; a winking self-awareness that affiliates it with more labored forms of literary metafiction yet lacks the overt self-consciousness with which the present story is hobbled. The present story now acknowledges that by basing itself on a specific earlier science-fiction story it is also indebted, paradoxically, to another: “The Nine Billion Names of God,” by Carter Scholz, which was based on “The Nine Billion Names of God,” by Arthur C. Clarke, and which has amused and obsessed the writer of the present story for decades. The story now acknowledges its utter colonization by its own procedure of serially confessing its sources. The story, which initially believed itself to be operating on a blank page, moving into a horizon of possibility, is dismayed by the likelihood that it has wandered instead into a sucking undertow of bungled authorial good intentions, the pathetic desire to write a story that will acknowledge its colonial crimes and historical debts. The Winnebago, moving with such innocent optimism across deserted Western spaces, may be blundering into a valley of palimpsest. The story is belated.",

She lay down on her seat, using her arm as a pillow, and dropped off straightaway, her head and feet pointing in the same direction as my father’s. Four o’clock came and she slept on, but I didn’t wake her, because my father’s vitals showed no sign of changing; they weren’t plummeting as she’d predicted. I didn’t feel tired at all, though my ass hurt from sitting still for so long and I had to wiggle it around. Then all of a sudden I needed to pee; the urge came out of nowhere, like someone pulling a sink plug. I said to the driver in a low voice, Hey, I need to pee, is there a rest area coming up? He didn’t answer and kept facing the road. I didn’t think I could hold it much longer, so I scuttled to the front and said, Sir, sorry to bother you, but I need to use the bathroom. Still, he said nothing, as if he found my request so ridiculous that merely replying would wound his dignity. I tapped his shoulder and said, Sir, I’m about to piss myself, could you stop? That was when I looked in the rearview mirror and saw that his eyes were shut. Startled, I thought, Wait, I must be mistaken—does he just have small eyes? I leaned forward and, no, he was fast asleep, breathing evenly, in through the nose and out through the mouth, even snoring lightly, every muscle in his face relaxed, a faint sheen of grease shining in the street lights, his hands still on the wheel. There was a slight bend in the road up ahead, and without hesitation he guided the vehicle around it, stepping on the accelerator and the clutch as needed. I grabbed his shoulder and shook him, but he didn’t wake up. Next I pinched the back of his neck, but again, nothing. He just jolted as if a needle had pierced his bum, rising a little from his seat before settling back down. We were going about ninety miles per hour, and I couldn’t stir him.",

Sensing something amiss, Dr. Xu forced herself to stay alert, watching Chen's behavior closely. He took a sharp turn onto an unfamiliar road, veering away from their planned route. When Dr. Xu quietly asked about the detour, Chen's response was terse and evasive. The air thickened with tension. Dr. Xu's hand slowly moved towards her phone, but Chen noticed and abruptly pulled over. For a moment, they sat in silence, the engine idling. Chen turned to her, his face a mix of apology and resolve. \"Dr. Xu,\" he said, \"there's something you need to know.\" His words would change everything about their journey and Dr. Xu's understanding of the situation.",

Pippa was bookish where Gillian was capable; she wore her hair pinned up, or in a long plait on one shoulder, which someone had once said—long ago, when it was still a rich chestnut brown—made her look like an Augustus John Gypsy. Still, you could see the two sisters’ close likeness: they were big and broad-shouldered like their father, with forthright, open pink faces, long, flat cheeks, an obstinate, set jaw. Both sisters had recently retired. Gillian had done something high up in management for the National Grid, and her husband had a business making thermostats for heating systems.

I told her that the only two people I’d seen rocking fanny packs in the past ten years had been jazz musicians. Well, they know what’s up, I guess. It’s perfect for a night about town. Could carry cigarettes, Mace . . . even a short novel, maybe? For the subway ride? I told her she could keep the fanny pack, because that seemed to be the reason she’d brought the whole matter up, and she’d been wearing it ever since. She didn’t walk around conspicuously sporting the fanny pack (That’s how you get mugged, she said) but concealed it under her sweaters. After her fall, she started wearing ample sweaters, not the lousy kind you see on depressive people but sweaters of well-shaped ampleness, made of pretty wools. The way they draped over her waist and hips, you would never suspect there was a purple fanny pack under them at all times.",

Seeing a painting in a museum and making an effort to understand it was enough of a responsibility. Owning it would be too much. Owning it would be like inheriting a tree, being accountable for its existence even after the person who planted it had vanished. Yet a tree you can cut down with a permit and a reliable crew. A piece of art is like a child: you can’t use your mediocre imagination to change anything about it. On the other hand, you can’t put a price tag on a child; you can’t put him up for auction. Perhaps the SpongeBob man was talking about one’s progeny. You can’t share with others who your child truly is (Jude who talked about semidemisemiquavers and semihemidemisemiquavers at breakfast as though they were floating in his cereal bowl), and you hate to see him through their eyes (Jude who had made himself a sign in kindergarten—“Im Not taLKING because I DON’t WaNT TO!”—and had been mute at school ever since).",

The canvas displayed a woman with downcast eyes, sitting by a window with rain streaking down the glass. She wondered if the artist had painted her on a similarly gray day, if her sad expression was genuine or imagined by the artist. A brief, distorted reflection merged her expression with the figure's, blending their features in an eerie harmony. Was she mourning a lost love or lamenting a missed opportunity? Did she yearn for a lost love, or had she simply accepted her fate? The SpongeBob man's presence was incongruent but grounding, reminding her that not all parts of life were desperate. She tore her eyes from the painting and looked around at the other visitors, wondering if others also connected with the art, feeling understood by paint strokes.",

He shares his memories of library books stacked high, pages softened and dog-eared with excitement, in which he encountered astonishing tales of misfits searching for belonging. But there's a hint of bitterness in his voice as he recalls how the stories always closed the same way—the protagonists, with their offbeat personalities and nonconforming interests, were accepted by society. He admits that he sought out darker narratives, stories where the outsiders remained on the fringes or established their own underground communities. The villain's eyes light up as he describes discovering ancient myths and legends, particularly those featuring trickster gods and cunning antiheroes. These characters' ability to manipulate others and bend rules fascinated him, encouraging small reconfigurations of his worldview before something more developed and compelling emerged. An uncharacteristic softness infiltrates his voice, and he confesses that he still revisits those beloved childhood stories. Now, however, he sympathizes more frequently with the antagonists. This revelation complicates the villain's disposition, suggesting that his current motivations may have originated from a childhood dominated by misunderstandings and isolation.",

I liked her name, which was Madeleine. She picked up my doll and began to walk her in silly, jouncing steps around the stump, seesawing her legs; I snatched her back. My belief in my dolls, at that point, was in a delicate balance. I knew that they were inert plastic and could be tumbled without consequences upside down and half naked in the toy box. At the same time, I seemed to feel the complex sensibility of each one, like an extra skin stretched taut and responsive, both in my mind and quite outside of me. Unlike my Teddy bear, who was capable of irony, this doll—her name was Teenager—was stiffly humorless. She was outraged by Madeleine’s travesty of real play.",

Also, a study had come in about health risks associated with working at call centers—it was a study out of Sweden, which I think is not a proper compare group, since those people go months without sunshine, and then months with too much sunshine—and so resources had been allocated to transform the unofficial smoke-break room into an official smoke-free meditation space, to conform to a new and surely reasonable regulation that a prescribed percentage of profit go to worker well-being. That plus the fact that other regulatory legislation had recently made it legal for the state’s prisons to run call centers, staffed by inmates, and for various reasons the prison call centers only had to pay the inmates/workers ninety-five cents an hour. . . .",
