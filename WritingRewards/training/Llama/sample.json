I remember that I had committed to becoming a novelist at a very young age. My domestic circumstances were somewhat fortunate: although my mother believed I could commit myself to more useful professions like law and medicine, my father had always supported my ambition to become a writer. But one memory of my father is more significant than the rest. I remember that when, as a young man, I wrote my first novel, “Cevdet Bay and His Sons,” I sent a copy to my father for his opinion. Till I heard back from him, my days were consumed by the anxiety of what he might have to say. I came to care for my father’s opinion and approval more than anyone else’s. I had been waiting for my father to return home. I wanted to know his thoughts. On the day of his arrival, I stood by the door of our house and looked at him like I was nothing more than a child. My father must have understood what I was asking him. He walked up to me and embraced me. Although he didn’t say a word, I understood that he approved of my manuscript. For a few days, my father refused to talk about the manuscript but later, one cold evening, he expressed a strong and optimistic confidence about my future writing career. Like a proud father he said \"Aslanım olacaksın.\" He didn’t name a prize but he predicted that I would go on to receive a prestigious one. When my father died in 2002, I looked outside the window and imagined that door by which I stood waiting for him and remembered his words of encouragement. Sometimes, when I am alone, I still feel the warmth of that embrace.\n\nParagraph 2:\nTwenty-three years before my father left me his suitcase, and four years after I had decided, at the age of twenty-two, to become a novelist, and, abandoning all else, shut myself up in a room, I finished my first novel, “Cevdet Bey and His Sons.” With trembling hands, I gave my father a typescript of the still unpublished novel, so that he could read it and tell me what he thought. I did this not only because I had confidence in his taste and his intellect; his opinion was very important to me because, unlike my mother, he had not opposed my wish to become a writer. At that point, my father was not with us, but far away. I waited impatiently for his return. When he arrived, two weeks later, I ran to open the door. My father said nothing, but he immediately threw his arms around me in a way that told me he had liked the book very much. For a while, we were plunged into the sort of awkward silence that often accompanies moments of great emotion. Then, when we had calmed down and begun to talk, my father resorted to highly charged and exaggerated language to express his confidence in me and in my first novel: he told me that one day I would win the prize that I have now received with such great happiness. He said this not because he was trying to convince me of his good opinion or to set the prize as a goal; he said it like a Turkish father, supporting his son, encouraging him by saying, “One day you’ll be a pasha!” For years, whenever he saw me, he would encourage me with the same words.My father died in December, 2002.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n", "role": "user"}, {"content": "{\"preference\": \"2\"}", "role": "assistant"}]}
