For instance, between my thumb and my index, lights flicker on and off in a miniature window. If I elongate my fingers I could also hold the silver skyscrapers tearing into the clouds. How astonishing; the skyline\u2019s ants and beasts fit right, and wrong, into my palms. Back in my father's village nothing, absolutely nothing, fit into my hands. There were no neat edges anywhere, no contrast, nothing for me to want to try to hold. In short, there is no place I feel less alone than here, alone on this bench in New York, where the skyline is ours, and we are the skyline, my eyes staring straight into the material manifestation of a second person plural. In the future, they will say this skyline was synonymous with every art, every intimate form that has ever, or will ever, exist. To say we are the skyline is to confirm a collective identity, to confirm a stake in what makes up the city's sublime marrow; bundled debt, traces of antidepressants in the water, traffic networks, and shifting weather patterns. As an artist it will be my mission to transmute bad forms of collectivity into a sculpture of the communal body of the future. There is something Noor said once, in response to my ideas about the fiction of the world, that I am desperately trying to forget. We were not speaking the way people speak, necessarily, but more like skies, or skylines, when a passing cloud whispered something about a mirror. The disembodied voice said one cannot recognize oneself and at once be identical with oneself. But one plus one plus one equals three, if my math is correct. So maybe we multiply, keep multiplying, and our past and present and future selves never leave, and maybe that is what Noor really meant when she said the world has no genre you can name. The midnight air does nothing to unflatten my hair beneath the bandana. I would mistake this moment for a dream if I had not just consumed an irresponsible quantity of unsulfured mango, the juice all over my fingers.

        "paragraph1": "Before I left the country, a billionaire invited me to lunch at a London club. I\u2019m working on a software for HR operations, he said. He wore an outfit that defied the club\u2019s dress code: a dark T-shirt and darker jeans. It uses a predictive algorithm, he said, that scrapes employee backgrounds, e-mails, and market trends to identify which ones are likeliest to betray their companies. But I\u2019ve been getting carried away. I\u2019m starting a literary magazine; let\u2019s discuss it. Unfortunately, by the time the literary subject came up, I\u2019d already finished my entree and needed to leave for the airport. He insisted on paying for my taxi, which I accepted. I was late for my flight and carried a heavy suitcase. The billionaire had spent most of our lunch sharing his life story, which began with him as a humble public-school student and ended with him becoming the wealthy man leaning back in the chair across from me. I figured he wanted to use the literary magazine as a launchpad to becoming a writer himself. It wouldn\u2019t be a ridiculous notion\u2014he bought his way into a number of things. He told me he\u2019d built a floating wind farm, located offshore from the township he was designing to house its workers. He also said he had a scheme to eliminate lawyers from people\u2019s everyday lives and personal problems. For fun, he played drums in a psychedelic rock band, though he wasn\u2019t writing any original songs. He was expecting his eleventh child, a surprise pregnancy; he and his wife had recently adopted quadruplets from Guatemala. Throughout the lunch, I found it difficult to respond thoughtfully, or even adequately, to the billionaire\u2019s many ventures and projects. The waitresses kept bringing in appetizers on porcelain plates\u2014foie gras, baked brie, oysters\u2014and drinks in crystal glasses\u2014mimosas, champagne. The billionaire jumped from topic to topic, and when his voice rose an octave as he described eliminating inefficiencies, he reminded me of a child barreling through the halls of an opulent mansion. At the end of lunch, he put me in the taxi and said, Enjoy yourself in Athens. I didn\u2019t remember telling him where I was going?",
        "paragraph2": "Before the flight I was invited for lunch at a London club with a billionaire I\u2019d been promised had liberal credentials. He talked in his open-necked shirt about the new software he was developing, that could help organisations identify the employees most likely to rob and betray them in the future. We were meant to be discussing a literary magazine he was thinking of starting up: unfortunately I had to leave before we arrived at that subject.

I\u2019m working on a software for HR operations, he said. He wore an outfit that defied the club\u2019s dress code: a dark T-shirt and darker jeans. It uses a predictive algorithm, he said, that scrapes employee backgrounds, e-mails, and market trends to identify which ones are likeliest to betray their companies. But I\u2019ve been getting carried away. I\u2019m starting a literary magazine; let\u2019s discuss it. Unfortunately, by the time the literary subject came up, I\u2019d already finished my entree and needed to leave for the airport. He insisted on paying for my taxi, which I accepted. I was late for my flight and carried a heavy suitcase. The billionaire had spent most of our lunch sharing his life story, which began with him as a humble public-school student and ended with him becoming the wealthy man leaning back in the chair across from me. I figured he wanted to use the literary magazine as a launchpad to becoming a writer himself. It wouldn\u2019t be a ridiculous notion\u2014he bought his way into a number of things. He told me he\u2019d built a floating wind farm, located offshore from the township he was designing to house its workers. He also said he had a scheme to eliminate lawyers from people\u2019s everyday lives and personal problems. For fun, he played drums in a psychedelic rock band, though he wasn\u2019t writing any original songs. He was expecting his eleventh child, a surprise pregnancy; he and his wife had recently adopted quadruplets from Guatemala. Throughout the lunch, I found it difficult to respond thoughtfully, or even adequately, to the billionaire\u2019s many ventures and projects. The waitresses kept bringing in appetizers on porcelain plates\u2014foie gras, baked brie, oysters\u2014and drinks in crystal glasses\u2014mimosas, champagne. The billionaire jumped from topic to topic, and when his voice rose an octave as he described eliminating inefficiencies, he reminded me of a child barreling through the halls of an opulent mansion. At the end of lunch, he put me in the taxi and said, Enjoy yourself in Athens. I didn\u2019t remember telling him where I was going?\n\nParagraph 2:\nBefore the flight I was invited for lunch at a London club with a billionaire I\u2019d been promised had liberal credentials. He talked in his open-necked shirt about the new software he was developing, that could help organisations identify the employees most likely to rob and betray them in the future.

        "paragraph1": "There are times when to long for something is almost as satisfying as to finally receive it, or when the essence of that which is desired is evoked so clearly that to receive it is no longer necessary. As when one yearns to pluck a berry from the vine and savor its ripeness, so that the sweetness seems to precede the taste of the juice itself. Sylvie had said earlier that in springtime we could pick berries here. I searched for Sylvie's hand beside mine, but I found that she had slipped away silently and left me alone in the clearing. Yet in some way, I felt I could sense her closeness and thought she might be watching me from the woods, so I showed no change in my expression and pretended to be ignorant of my solitude. Around me, the sun cast long shadows through the partings of the tree branches, from which the browned leaves had already begun to fall into the clearing. A thin layer of frost was formed on the mud around where I sat. I imagined forming out of this cold clay earth a statue of a woman whom I would adorn with rare flowers. She would be a calm presence standing among the trees, not the cold, hard pillar of salt into which Lot's wife was transformed as punishment for her desire, for turning back with regret to look at all she had lost. A figure free of yearning, around whom the wild children of the forest would gather to marvel at her beauty and warmth. They would take solace in the vivacious beauty of such a figure and cling to her almost as a mother, even as her frozen hands could not caress them as one would their own children. Again I looked for Sylvie and thought of how I was, in searching for someone who had left me, not unlike the poor woman who had been turned to salt. Unlike the taste of those imagined berries, I was not sure if my longing for connection could ever be quite enough to evoke the presence of the thing itself.",
        "paragraph2": "To crave and to have are as like as a thing and its shadow. For when does a berry break upon the tongue as sweetly as when one longs to taste it, and when is the taste refracted into so many hues and savors of ripeness and earth, and when do our senses know any thing so utterly as when we lack it? And here again is a foreshadowing\u2014the world will be made whole. For to wish for a hand on one\u2019s hair is all but to feel it. So whatever we may lose, very craving gives it back to us again. Though we dream and hardly know it, longing, like an angel, fosters us, smooths our hair, and brings us wild strawberries.Sylvie was gone. She had left without a word, or a sound. I thought she must be teasing, perhaps watching me from the woods. I pretended not to know I was alone. I could see why Sylvie thought children might come here. Any child who saw once how the gleaming water spilled to the tips of branches, and rounded and dropped and pocked the softening shadows of frost at the foot of each tree, would come to see it again.If there had been snow I would have made a statue, a woman to stand along the path, among the trees. The children would have come close, to look at her. Lot\u2019s wife was salt and barren, because she was full of loss and mourning, and looked back. But here rare flowers would gleam in her hair, and on her breast, and in her hands, and there would be children all around her, to love and marvel at her for her beauty, and to laugh at her extravagant adornments, as if they had set the flowers in her hair and thrown down all the flowers at her feet, and they would forgive her, eagerly and lavishly, for turning away, though she never asked to be forgiven. Though her hands were ice and did not touch them, she would be more than mother to them, she so calm, so still, and they such wild and orphan things.",

As when one yearns to pluck a berry from the vine and savor its ripeness, so that the sweetness seems to precede the taste of the juice itself. Sylvie had said earlier that in springtime we could pick berries here. I searched for Sylvie's hand beside mine, but I found that she had slipped away silently and left me alone in the clearing. Yet in some way, I felt I could sense her closeness and thought she might be watching me from the woods, so I showed no change in my expression and pretended to be ignorant of my solitude. Around me, the sun cast long shadows through the partings of the tree branches, from which the browned leaves had already begun to fall into the clearing. A thin layer of frost was formed on the mud around where I sat. I imagined forming out of this cold clay earth a statue of a woman whom I would adorn with rare flowers. She would be a calm presence standing among the trees, not the cold, hard pillar of salt into which Lot's wife was transformed as punishment for her desire, for turning back with regret to look at all she had lost. A figure free of yearning, around whom the wild children of the forest would gather to marvel at her beauty and warmth. They would take solace in the vivacious beauty of such a figure and cling to her almost as a mother, even as her frozen hands could not caress them as one would their own children. Again I looked for Sylvie and thought of how I was, in searching for someone who had left me, not unlike the poor woman who had been turned to salt. Unlike the taste of those imagined berries, I was not sure if my longing for connection could ever be quite enough to evoke the presence of the thing itself.\n\nParagraph 2:\nTo crave and to have are as like as a thing and its shadow. For when does a berry break upon the tongue as sweetly as when one longs to taste it, and when is the taste refracted into so many hues and savors of ripeness and earth, and when do our senses know any thing so utterly as when we lack it? And here again is a foreshadowing\u2014the world will be made whole. For to wish for a hand on one\u2019s hair is all but to feel it. So whatever we may lose, very craving gives it back to us again. Though we dream and hardly know it, longing, like an angel, fosters us, smooths our hair, and brings us wild strawberries.Sylvie was gone. She had left without a word, or a sound. I thought she must be teasing, perhaps watching me from the woods. I pretended not to know I was alone. I could see why Sylvie thought children might come here. Any child who saw once how the gleaming water spilled to the tips of branches, and rounded and dropped and pocked the softening shadows of frost at the foot of each tree, would come to see it again.If there had been snow I would have made a statue, a woman to stand along the path, among the trees. The children would have come close, to look at her. Lot\u2019s wife was salt and barren, because she was full of loss and mourning, and looked back. But here rare flowers would gleam in her hair, and on her breast, and in her hands, and there would be children all around her, to love and marvel at her for her beauty, and to laugh at her extravagant adornments, as if they had set the flowers in her hair and thrown down all the flowers at her feet, and they would forgive her, eagerly and lavishly, for turning away, though she never asked to be forgiven. Though her hands were ice and did not touch them, she would be more than mother to them, she so calm, so still, and they such wild and orphan things.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Every minute of your life\u2019s suffering has argued otherwise. By every fact of history, it can\u2019t exist. This place must be a delusion, too. Yet here we are.And America, too, is a delusion, the grandest one of all. The white race believes\u2014believes with all its heart\u2014that it is their right to take the land. To kill Indians. Make war. Enslave their brothers. This nation shouldn\u2019t exist, if there is any justice in the world, for its foundations are murder, theft, and cruelty. Yet here we are.\u201cI\u2019m supposed to answer Mingo\u2019s call for gradual progress, for closing our doors to those in need. I\u2019m supposed to answer those who think this place is too close to the grievous influence of slavery, and that we should move west. I don\u2019t have an answer for you. I don\u2019t know what we should do. The word we. In some ways, the only thing we have in common is the color of our skin. Our ancestors came from all over the African continent. It\u2019s quite large. Brother Valentine has the maps of the world in his splendid library, you can look for yourself. They had different ways of subsistence, different customs, spoke a hundred different languages. And that great mixture was brought to America in the holds of slave ships. To the north, the south. Their sons and daughters picked tobacco, cultivated cotton, worked on the largest estates and smallest farms. We are craftsmen and midwives and preachers and peddlers. Black hands built the White House, the seat of our nation\u2019s government. The word we. We are not one people but many different people. How can one person speak for this great, beautiful race\u2014which is not one race but many, with a million desires and hopes and wishes for ourselves and our children?",
        "paragraph2": "Valentine Farm is what you get when a bunch of world-weary people dream of sanctuary. Like a dream, this collective delusion is gone by morning light. It\u2019s fake, a lie. Though if a place can be a haven, I wonder if Black Americans deserve the refuge more than anyone else. Certainly, after everything this country has stolen, we deserve something in return. But then I suspect that if there is a sanctuary to be found, Black Americans probably built it, just like they built the rest of this country. I fear it\u2019s impossible to find any semblance of peace inside a fa\u00e7ade you were forced to build. And no fa\u00e7ade is greater than America. America is the grandest delusion of them all, built on pillars of murder, theft, and cruelty. A cruelty that runs so deep in white Americans that it inspires entitlement, a fundamental belief that the land and lives of others is of no consequence to them, so why not take it? Justice can\u2019t breathe in a place like this. America\u2019s very existence contradicts the concept of right and wrong. What then, is the right thing to do? Do we stay here, and chip away at progress, do we close our doors to those in need, or do we throw it all away to run west, hoping to start anew in a place slavery never touched? Maybe we\u2019ll find buried gold, get rich, and erect a thousand new Valentine Farms. I just don\u2019t know. And who is \u201cwe\u201d anyways? Black Americans are no monolith. Africa saw thousands of languages, customs, and histories. The only thing that makes us a \u201cwe\u201d is slavery. Even in slavery, there was no uniformity. Craftsmen, midwives, laborers\u2014laborers who built the White House! There is no \u201cwe.\u201d Too many voices are clamoring to be heard, crying their many dreams and experiences and fears. No one voice will be able to speak for all these dreams.",

Who told you the negro deserved a place of refuge? Who told you that you had that right? Every minute of your life\u2019s suffering has argued otherwise. By every fact of history, it can\u2019t exist. This place must be a delusion, too. Yet here we are.And America, too, is a delusion, the grandest one of all. The white race believes\u2014believes with all its heart\u2014that it is their right to take the land. To kill Indians. Make war. Enslave their brothers. This nation shouldn\u2019t exist, if there is any justice in the world, for its foundations are murder, theft, and cruelty. Yet here we are.\u201cI\u2019m supposed to answer Mingo\u2019s call for gradual progress, for closing our doors to those in need. I\u2019m supposed to answer those who think this place is too close to the grievous influence of slavery, and that we should move west. I don\u2019t have an answer for you. I don\u2019t know what we should do. The word we. In some ways, the only thing we have in common is the color of our skin. Our ancestors came from all over the African continent. It\u2019s quite large. Brother Valentine has the maps of the world in his splendid library, you can look for yourself. They had different ways of subsistence, different customs, spoke a hundred different languages. And that great mixture was brought to America in the holds of slave ships. To the north, the south. Their sons and daughters picked tobacco, cultivated cotton, worked on the largest estates and smallest farms. We are craftsmen and midwives and preachers and peddlers. Black hands built the White House, the seat of our nation\u2019s government. The word we. We are not one people but many different people. How can one person speak for this great, beautiful race\u2014which is not one race but many, with a million desires and hopes and wishes for ourselves and our children?\n\nParagraph 2:\nValentine Farm is what you get when a bunch of world-weary people dream of sanctuary. Like a dream, this collective delusion is gone by morning light. It\u2019s fake, a lie. Though if a place can be a haven, I wonder if Black Americans deserve the refuge more than anyone else. Certainly, after everything this country has stolen, we deserve something in return. But then I suspect that if there is a sanctuary to be found, Black Americans probably built it, just like they built the rest of this country. I fear it\u2019s impossible to find any semblance of peace inside a fa\u00e7ade you were forced to build. And no fa\u00e7ade is greater than America. America is the grandest delusion of them all, built on pillars of murder, theft, and cruelty. A cruelty that runs so deep in white Americans that it inspires entitlement, a fundamental belief that the land and lives of others is of no consequence to them, so why not take it? Justice can\u2019t breathe in a place like this. America\u2019s very existence contradicts the concept of right and wrong. What then, is the right thing to do? Do we stay here, and chip away at progress, do we close our doors to those in need, or do we throw it all away to run west, hoping to start anew in a place slavery never touched? Maybe we\u2019ll find buried gold, get rich, and erect a thousand new Valentine Farms. I just don\u2019t know. And who is \u201cwe\u201d anyways? Black Americans are no monolith. Africa saw thousands of languages, customs, and histories. The only thing that makes us a \u201cwe\u201d is slavery. Even in slavery, there was no uniformity. Craftsmen, midwives, laborers\u2014laborers who built the White House! There is no \u201cwe.\u201d Too many voices are clamoring to be heard, crying their many dreams and experiences and fears. No one voice will be able to speak for all these dreams.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

With the sun stabbing at them through their window blinds, the two old men struggled to their feet and lurched out onto their adjacent verandas, emerging at almost the same moment, like characters in an ancient tale, trapped in fateful coincidences, unable to escape the consequences of chance.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

He swung a roque mallet steadily from side to side as he advanced up the staircase toward her. \u201cC\u2019mere, Wendy,\u201d he said, \u201cor I\u2019ll paint this wall with your pretty, pink little brains.\u201d Wendy turned back around and willed herself to keep going up the staircase. Her side was electric with pain, but she grit her teeth and kept going until she was in the corridor, where she broke into a run. She was almost at the end when a large figure jumped out in front of her. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta come to the party!\u201d he shouted. He wore a green mask with hideously contorted plastic features. \u201cParty favor?\u201d he said, and jammed a little box toward her. She darted around him and continued down the hall, running faster this time. A door slammed violently behind her, and she turned to see that the man had disappeared.The pain in her side was becoming so severe that, when she took her next step forward, she collapsed under the agony of it. She tried to contain her scream, but it came roaring out of her anyway. She balled her hands into fists and pounded them into the carpet, which appeared to move beneath her, the patterns snakelike and fluid.The elevator made an ominous noise as it crept up the shaft, and she got on her knees, gripping the wall to try and stand. The elevator doors peeled open, revealing Jack with his heavy mallet. He spotted her and smiled. \u201cThose pretty brains,\u201d he said, and staggered in her direction. She began to run again, and he was behind her quickly. She felt the whoosh of the mallet, the air from its force grazing the back of her neck. She ducked away, and watched as Jack\u2019s momentum sent him tumbling face-down onto the carpet, blood scattering like gory diamonds. She continued down the hall without looking back, her gasps so loud they blocked out all other sound.",

Bash them right to fuck in.\u201d He struggled up another riser.Panic spurred her, and the ache in her side diminished a little. She pulled herself up as fast as she could regardless of the pain, yanking convulsively at the banister. She reached the top and threw a glance behind her.He seemed to be gaining strength rather than losing it. He was only four risers from the top, measuring the distance with the roque mallet in his left hand as he pulled himself up with his right.\u201cRight behind you,\u201d he panted through his bloody grin, as if reading her mind. \u201cRight behind you now, bitch. With your medicine.\u201d She fled stumblingly down the main corridor, hands pressed to her side.The door to one of the rooms jerked open and a man with a green ghoulmask on popped out. \u201cGreat party, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he screamed into her face, and pulled the waxed string of a party favor.

Jack had a malevolent smile on his face, and blood dripped from his open mouth down his chin like fruit juice. He swung a roque mallet steadily from side to side as he advanced up the staircase toward her. \u201cC\u2019mere, Wendy,\u201d he said, \u201cor I\u2019ll paint this wall with your pretty, pink little brains.\u201d Wendy turned back around and willed herself to keep going up the staircase. Her side was electric with pain, but she grit her teeth and kept going until she was in the corridor, where she broke into a run. She was almost at the end when a large figure jumped out in front of her. \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta come to the party!\u201d he shouted. He wore a green mask with hideously contorted plastic features. \u201cParty favor?\u201d he said, and jammed a little box toward her. She darted around him and continued down the hall, running faster this time. A door slammed violently behind her, and she turned to see that the man had disappeared.The pain in her side was becoming so severe that, when she took her next step forward, she collapsed under the agony of it. She tried to contain her scream, but it came roaring out of her anyway. She balled her hands into fists and pounded them into the carpet, which appeared to move beneath her, the patterns snakelike and fluid.The elevator made an ominous noise as it crept up the shaft, and she got on her knees, gripping the wall to try and stand. The elevator doors peeled open, revealing Jack with his heavy mallet. He spotted her and smiled. \u201cThose pretty brains,\u201d he said, and staggered in her direction. She began to run again, and he was behind her quickly. She felt the whoosh of the mallet, the air from its force grazing the back of her neck. She ducked away, and watched as Jack\u2019s momentum sent him tumbling face-down onto the carpet, blood scattering like gory diamonds. She continued down the hall without looking back, her gasps so loud they blocked out all other sound.\n\nParagraph 2:\nWendy risked another glance over her shoulder. Jack was on the sixth riser, clinging to the banister much as she was doing herself. He was still grinning, and dark blood oozed slowly through the grin and slipped down the line of his jaw. He bared his teeth at her.\u201cI\u2019m going to bash your brains in. Bash them right to fuck in.\u201d He struggled up another riser.Panic spurred her, and the ache in her side diminished a little. She pulled herself up as fast as she could regardless of the pain, yanking convulsively at the banister. She reached the top and threw a glance behind her.He seemed to be gaining strength rather than losing it. He was only four risers from the top, measuring the distance with the roque mallet in his left hand as he pulled himself up with his right.\u201cRight behind you,\u201d he panted through his bloody grin, as if reading her mind. \u201cRight behind you now, bitch. With your medicine.\u201d She fled stumblingly down the main corridor, hands pressed to her side.The door to one of the rooms jerked open and a man with a green ghoulmask on popped out. \u201cGreat party, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he screamed into her face, and pulled the waxed string of a party favor. There was an echoing bang and suddenly crepe streamers were drifting all around her. The man in the ghoulmask cackled and slammed back into his room. She fell forward onto the carpet, full-length. Her right side seemed to explode with pain, and she fought off the blackness of unconsciousness desperately.

        "paragraph1": "Thomas Wolfe warned in the title of America\u2019s great novel that \u201cYou Can\u2019t Go Home Again.\u201d I enjoyed the book but I never agreed with the title. I believe that one can never leave home. I believe that one carries the shadows, the dreams, the fears and dragons of home under one\u2019s skin, at the extreme corners of ones eyes and possibly in the gristle of the ear lobe.Home is that youthful region where a child is the only real living inhabitant. Parents, siblings, and neighbors, are mysterious apparitions, who come, go, and do strange unfathomable things in and around the child, the region\u2019s only enfranchised citizen.Geography, as such, has little meaning to the child observer. If one grows up in the Southwest, the desert and open skies are natural. New York, with the elevators and subway rumble and millions of people, and Southeast Florida with its palm trees and sun and beaches are to the children of those regions the way the outer world is, has been, and will always be. Since the child cannot control that environment, she has to find her own place, a region where only she lives and no one else can enter.I am convinced that most people do not grow up. We find parking spaces and honor our credit cards. We marry and dare to have children and call that growing up. I think what we do is mostly grow old. We carry accumulation of years in our bodies and on our faces, but generally our real selves, the children inside, are still innocent and shy as magnolias.We may act sophisticated and worldly but I believe we feel safest when we go inside ourselves and find home, a place where we belong and maybe the only place we really do.",
        "paragraph2": "I imagined him taller than he should have been, his head near the ceiling of an unfamiliar apartment he couldn\u2019t love as he wrote his novel You Can\u2019t Go Home Again looming over his refrigerator. Home, to Thomas Wolfe, was a quiet town in a temperate valley of the Blue Ridge Mountains. From such vantage points, the world becomes diminutive, entirely comprehensible. Only when you venture into those views do you see the world\u2019s vastness beyond its landscapes, how you can\u2019t see home through eyes that have left, that have taken in new views, new worlds, a new you. But can home be truly gone without you? Is home not a dark chamber you carry within, with its shadows, dreams, fears, and dragons? I remembered my childhood home for the woods that circled the property, where things belonged because they resided there. A childhood home is the childhood. It is the wilderness unknowing children frolic through. It is the security of a warm blanket before they learn it can be ripped away. The adults in their lives seem impossibly, staggeringly old, years beyond the years children know.

        "text_input": "You are given two pararaphs of writing for a given instruction.\nYour task is to determine which paragraph is overall better in terms of writing quality.\n\nParagraph 1:\nThomas Wolfe warned in the title of America\u2019s great novel that \u201cYou Can\u2019t Go Home Again.\u201d I enjoyed the book but I never agreed with the title. I believe that one can never leave home. I believe that one carries the shadows, the dreams, the fears and dragons of home under one\u2019s skin, at the extreme corners of ones eyes and possibly in the gristle of the ear lobe.Home is that youthful region where a child is the only real living inhabitant. Parents, siblings, and neighbors, are mysterious apparitions, who come, go, and do strange unfathomable things in and around the child, the region\u2019s only enfranchised citizen.Geography, as such, has little meaning to the child observer. If one grows up in the Southwest, the desert and open skies are natural. New York, with the elevators and subway rumble and millions of people, and Southeast Florida with its palm trees and sun and beaches are to the children of those regions the way the outer world is, has been, and will always be. Since the child cannot control that environment, she has to find her own place, a region where only she lives and no one else can enter.I am convinced that most people do not grow up. We find parking spaces and honor our credit cards. We marry and dare to have children and call that growing up. I think what we do is mostly grow old. We carry accumulation of years in our bodies and on our faces, but generally our real selves, the children inside, are still innocent and shy as magnolias.We may act sophisticated and worldly but I believe we feel safest when we go inside ourselves and find home, a place where we belong and maybe the only place we really do.\n\nParagraph 2:\nI imagined him taller than he should have been, his head near the ceiling of an unfamiliar apartment he couldn\u2019t love as he wrote his novel You Can\u2019t Go Home Again looming over his refrigerator. Home, to Thomas Wolfe, was a quiet town in a temperate valley of the Blue Ridge Mountains. From such vantage points, the world becomes diminutive, entirely comprehensible. Only when you venture into those views do you see the world\u2019s vastness beyond its landscapes, how you can\u2019t see home through eyes that have left, that have taken in new views, new worlds, a new you. But can home be truly gone without you? Is home not a dark chamber you carry within, with its shadows, dreams, fears, and dragons? I remembered my childhood home for the woods that circled the property, where things belonged because they resided there. A childhood home is the childhood. It is the wilderness unknowing children frolic through. It is the security of a warm blanket before they learn it can be ripped away. The adults in their lives seem impossibly, staggeringly old, years beyond the years children know. Like enigmatic peaks of mountain ranges, parents, older siblings, and neighbors loom from a distance. They cast only shadows on the sunny region of play that is the childhood home. But the sun falls and the shadows grow long. With time, the children grow taller than they should, than they feel they should. They leave the wilderness. Through the vague groping around in the night to their parkings spaces and their dinner tables strewn with bills, they long for childhood, for return. But as sure as that longing pulls from within them, there is that dark chamber waiting for light. It has always been there.

        "paragraph1": "That night at the hotel, in our room with the long empty hall outside and our shoes outside the door, a thick carpet on the floor of the room, outside the windows the rain falling and in the room light and pleasant and cheerful, then the light out and it exciting with smooth sheets and the bed comfortable, feeling that we had come home, feeling no longer alone, waking in the night to find the other one there, and not gone away; all other things were unreal. We slept when we were tired and if we woke the other one woke too so one was not alone. Often a man wishes to be alone and a girl wishes to be alone too and if they love each other they are jealous of that in each other, but I can truly say we never felt that. We could feel alone when we were together, alone against the others. It has only happened to me like that once. I have been alone while I was with many girls and that is the way that you can be most lonely. But we were never lonely and never afraid when we were together.I know that the night is not the same as the day: that all things are different, that the things of the night cannot be explained in the day, because they do not then exist, and the night can be a dreadful time for lonely people once their loneliness has started. But with Catherine there was almost no difference in the night except that it was an even better time. If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.",

She\u2019d been clearer to me than myself, because I didn\u2019t spend all day studying myself the way I spent all day studying her. My investigation was not complete.

We slept when we were tired and if we woke the other one woke too so one was not alone. Often a man wishes to be alone and a girl wishes to be alone too and if they love each other they are jealous of that in each other, but I can truly say we never felt that. We could feel alone when we were together, alone against the others. It has only happened to me like that once. I have been alone while I was with many girls and that is the way that you can be most lonely. But we were never lonely and never afraid when we were together.I know that the night is not the same as the day: that all things are different, that the things of the night cannot be explained in the day, because they do not then exist, and the night can be a dreadful time for lonely people once their loneliness has started. But with Catherine there was almost no difference in the night except that it was an even better time. If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.\n\nParagraph 2:\nWe looked around the hotel room when we opened the door. To be away together! Catherine\u2019s arm looped around my shoulders with mine around her waist. She\u2019d been clearer to me than myself, because I didn\u2019t spend all day studying myself the way I spent all day studying her. My investigation was not complete.

He did this because I was a relative\u2014it\u2019s unlikely that he even considered whether we were suited to spending time together.

The war was far away and beyond my understanding, but the dread and threat of it spilled across the ocean and flooded every home in my city. Lots of our men were off fighting, and lots of them would never come home. Rations of oil and sugar were dispensed through clenched fists. We spent many nights huddled around the radio and forgetting to breathe. It was a time of need, which is\u2014according to the comic books\u2014the perfect time for a hero to arrive. Newark\u2019s wartime hero was a high school boy named Seymour Irving Levov, who we nicknamed \u201cThe Swede\u201d because of his blond hair and blue eyes. He was a paragon of greatness in my neighborhood, and his athletic ability was the stuff of legend; regardless of the sport he played, he always clinched the win for his team. The Swede\u2019s consistent excellence in football, basketball, and baseball gave my community something to rally for. Being Jewish, most of us tended to prioritize academic achievements over physical feats, but the Swede changed things. We\u2019d turn up to his games with homemade banners and clumsily invented cheers, among them \u201cS-W-E-D-E, get this team to victory!\u201d Watching the force of his kick, the graceful arch of his throw, and the shattering power of his swing shrouded us in a feeling of awe that was rarely experienced outside of Temple. When the Swede was on the field or on the court, my whole neighborhood was in the palm of his hand. He had unwittingly become a symbol of invincibility, of innocence, of hope that the terrible war would leave us unscathed, passed over like we had smeared lamb blood on our doors. Looking back, I don\u2019t know if our hero arrived or if our hero was created, but the Swede was more than willing to shoulder the burden.",
        "paragraph2": "The Swede. During the war years, when I was still a grade school boy, this was a magical name in our Newark neighborhood, even to adults just a generation removed from the city's old Prince Street ghetto and not yet so flawlessly Americanized as to be bowled over by the prowess of a high school athlete. The name was magical; so was the anomalous face. Of the few fair-complexioned Jewish students in our preponderantly Jewish public high school, none possessed anything remotely like the steep-jawed, insentient Viking mask of this blue-eyed blond born into our tribe as Seymour Irving Levov.The Swede starred as end in football, center in basketball, and first baseman in baseball. Only the basketball team was ever any good\u2014twice winning the city championship while he was its leading scorer\u2014but as long as the Swede excelled, the fate of our sports teams didn't matter much to a student body whose elders, largely undereducated and overburdened, venerated academic achievement above all else. Physical aggression, even camouflaged by athletic uniforms and official rules and intended to do no harm to Jews, was not a traditional source of pleasure in our community\u2014advanced degrees were. Nonetheless, through the Swede, the neighborhood entered into a fantasy about itself and about the world, the fantasy of sports fans everywhere: almost like Gentiles (as they imagined Gentiles), our families could forget the way things actually work and make an athletic performance the repository of all their hopes. Primarily, they could forget the war.The elevation of Swede Levov into the household Apollo of the Weequahic Jews can best be explained, I think, by the war against the Germans and the Japanese and the fears that it fostered. With the Swede indomitable on the playing field, the meaningless surface of life provided a bizarre, delusionary kind of sustenance, the happy release into a Swedian innocence, for those who lived in dread of never seeing their sons or their brothers or their husbands again.",

We\u2019d turn up to his games with homemade banners and clumsily invented cheers, among them \u201cS-W-E-D-E, get this team to victory!\u201d Watching the force of his kick, the graceful arch of his throw, and the shattering power of his swing shrouded us in a feeling of awe that was rarely experienced outside of Temple. When the Swede was on the field or on the court, my whole neighborhood was in the palm of his hand. He had unwittingly become a symbol of invincibility, of innocence, of hope that the terrible war would leave us unscathed, passed over like we had smeared lamb blood on our doors. Looking back, I don\u2019t know if our hero arrived or if our hero was created, but the Swede was more than willing to shoulder the burden.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe Swede. During the war years, when I was still a grade school boy, this was a magical name in our Newark neighborhood, even to adults just a generation removed from the city's old Prince Street ghetto and not yet so flawlessly Americanized as to be bowled over by the prowess of a high school athlete. The name was magical; so was the anomalous face. Of the few fair-complexioned Jewish students in our preponderantly Jewish public high school, none possessed anything remotely like the steep-jawed, insentient Viking mask of this blue-eyed blond born into our tribe as Seymour Irving Levov.The Swede starred as end in football, center in basketball, and first baseman in baseball. Only the basketball team was ever any good\u2014twice winning the city championship while he was its leading scorer\u2014but as long as the Swede excelled, the fate of our sports teams didn't matter much to a student body whose elders, largely undereducated and overburdened, venerated academic achievement above all else. Physical aggression, even camouflaged by athletic uniforms and official rules and intended to do no harm to Jews, was not a traditional source of pleasure in our community\u2014advanced degrees were. Nonetheless, through the Swede, the neighborhood entered into a fantasy about itself and about the world, the fantasy of sports fans everywhere: almost like Gentiles (as they imagined Gentiles), our families could forget the way things actually work and make an athletic performance the repository of all their hopes. Primarily, they could forget the war.The elevation of Swede Levov into the household Apollo of the Weequahic Jews can best be explained, I think, by the war against the Germans and the Japanese and the fears that it fostered. With the Swede indomitable on the playing field, the meaningless surface of life provided a bizarre, delusionary kind of sustenance, the happy release into a Swedian innocence, for those who lived in dread of never seeing their sons or their brothers or their husbands again.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

The waiter looked us up and down, seeing what we were immediately. I was pale from the winter, dressed in my worn, washed clothes. I wore spectacles, awkward and out of fashion, the kind you could buy at a steep discount. The waiter directed us to a shared table at the back of the restaurant, in front of the wash closet. At first my experience of discomfort was limited only to me. My father still had a big smile, ear to ear. But then I saw another father-daughter pair at a table in the restaurant\u2019s big window. The girl was around my age, and pretty. She dealt with the restaurant staff confidently, with a confiding air, like they shared a special secret. I watched the girl longingly. Her tanned legs ended in delicate buckled shoes. I watched her eat food I could not identify. Back then, I\u2019d never had yoghurt.As the waiter laughed and spoke to them in earshot of us, I saw my father growing red. \u201cThose potatoes were pig slop,\u201d he said after we left the restaurant, again and again. It embarrassed me. It was clear enough to both of us what had happened. At least, it was clear that we\u2019d both had a bad time. I knew what he was saying. We had been treated as second-class citizens because we ordered the prix fixe, instead of selecting expensive dishes \u00e0 la carte like the more sophisticated clientele.

My father and I were seated at the end of a long table set up for the group. The waiters were paying little attention to us; we had to wait a long time between courses. At a small table nearby sat a girl aged fourteen or fifteen, suntanned, in a low-cut dress, and an elderly man who appeared to be her father.They were talking and laughing quite freely, completely at ease, oblivious of other people. She was dipping into a thick milky substance in a glass \u2012 some years later I learnt this was yogurt, which people like us had never heard of. I caught sight of myself in the mirror, pale and sad-looking with my spectacles, silently sitting beside my father, who was staring into the far distance. I could see everything that separated me from that girl yet I wouldn\u2019t have known what to do to resemble her.Afterward, my father complained with unusual vehemence about this restaurant, where he claimed we had been served mashed potatoes made with \u201cpig slop,\u201d white and tasteless. Several weeks later, he was still venting his anger over the meal and its disgraceful \u201cpig slop.\u201d Although he never actually said so \u2012 it was probably then that I began decoding his speech \u2012 it was his way of expressing resentment at having been treated with contempt because we were not chic customers who ate \u201c\u00e0 la carte.\u201d",

I wore spectacles, awkward and out of fashion, the kind you could buy at a steep discount. The waiter directed us to a shared table at the back of the restaurant, in front of the wash closet. At first my experience of discomfort was limited only to me. My father still had a big smile, ear to ear. But then I saw another father-daughter pair at a table in the restaurant\u2019s big window. The girl was around my age, and pretty. She dealt with the restaurant staff confidently, with a confiding air, like they shared a special secret. I watched the girl longingly. Her tanned legs ended in delicate buckled shoes. I watched her eat food I could not identify. Back then, I\u2019d never had yoghurt.As the waiter laughed and spoke to them in earshot of us, I saw my father growing red. \u201cThose potatoes were pig slop,\u201d he said after we left the restaurant, again and again. It embarrassed me. It was clear enough to both of us what had happened. At least, it was clear that we\u2019d both had a bad time. I knew what he was saying. We had been treated as second-class citizens because we ordered the prix fixe, instead of selecting expensive dishes \u00e0 la carte like the more sophisticated clientele. I wanted to forget about it. If we didn\u2019t speak of the event, then perhaps it wasn\u2019t real.\n\nParagraph 2:\nOne evening \u2012 it was our last day \u2012 in Tours, we had dinner in a brightly-lit restaurant where the walls were lined with mirrors, frequented by a sophisticated clientele. My father and I were seated at the end of a long table set up for the group. The waiters were paying little attention to us; we had to wait a long time between courses. At a small table nearby sat a girl aged fourteen or fifteen, suntanned, in a low-cut dress, and an elderly man who appeared to be her father.They were talking and laughing quite freely, completely at ease, oblivious of other people. She was dipping into a thick milky substance in a glass \u2012 some years later I learnt this was yogurt, which people like us had never heard of. I caught sight of myself in the mirror, pale and sad-looking with my spectacles, silently sitting beside my father, who was staring into the far distance. I could see everything that separated me from that girl yet I wouldn\u2019t have known what to do to resemble her.Afterward, my father complained with unusual vehemence about this restaurant, where he claimed we had been served mashed potatoes made with \u201cpig slop,\u201d white and tasteless. Several weeks later, he was still venting his anger over the meal and its disgraceful \u201cpig slop.\u201d Although he never actually said so \u2012 it was probably then that I began decoding his speech \u2012 it was his way of expressing resentment at having been treated with contempt because we were not chic customers who ate \u201c\u00e0 la carte.\u201d\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Part of him had believed that as long as his proclivities resided only in his head, and sometimes on his computer, they didn\u2019t \u201ccount.\u201d Now everyone will know; his sexuality will exist as an open fact. After sending the email, he turns off his phone and spends the night vomiting from stress.But the response is unanimously supportive. His friends reply with the visible spectrum of heart emojis. His coworkers politely underreact (\u201cOh neat! Psyched for you\u201d). Kant\u2019s parents are not thrilled exactly\u2014they wish he\u2019d called them first, though he couldn\u2019t fathom doing this twice\u2014yet they are neither disapproving nor surprised. The recent legalization of gay marriage probably helped; mainly his parents want to know whether he still plans on having kids, and he says yes, just to give them something.Perversely he sort of wishes the response had been more dramatic and adverse, to give him something to overcome, forcing growth in the process, though he knows he doesn\u2019t really want that. But having tailored his life to compensate for its lack of relationships, there\u2019s nothing compelling him to act on his new freedom, and instead he\u2019s masturbating more than ever. He will recall this post-coming-out phase of his life as the Year of Damp Feet, spent forever popping into the shower to rinse off his dick and stomach.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

I would have gotten him back, I really would, but it\u2019s difficult to date when you\u2019re seven months pregnant. That\u2019s a joke. I\u2019m laughing as I write it.

I cry in a lot of places, but I do most of my crying in my father\u2019s New York apartment, surrounded by that mocking cuckoo clock and all the uncomfortable plastic furniture.

Let this be a reminder of how hungry I am for you. xoxo- Thelma. I remember the sound as I snapped the book shut. I remember Sam grabbing for it, wondering why story time was over before it had begun. I can see her when I close my eyes, hunched over that sweet and unassuming book, a hippo herself with that round, smug face, those manly teeth, that grayish skin. To be cheated on when you are seven months pregnant, by your second husband, is one thing. To be cheated on with a woman who resembles a cartoon hippo is entirely another. This, more than anything, is what makes me cry when I\u2019m alone with just my father\u2019s cuckoo clock and the rubber loveseat to keep me company.",

Or, I don\u2019t know, maybe you should suspect it more from a second husband. And that name. Thelma Rice. Like a villain in a Roald Dahl book. Imagine my shame, telling people I had been cheated on, at thirty-eight, with a woman named Thelma Rice? I would have gotten him back, I really would, but it\u2019s difficult to date when you\u2019re seven months pregnant. That\u2019s a joke. I\u2019m laughing as I write it. I admit that it feels sad when it\u2019s on paper. The laughter I can hear now is the worst kind: sympathetic laughter. The truth is, I don\u2019t laugh often these days. I cry and cry and cry. I cry in a lot of places, but I do most of my crying in my father\u2019s New York apartment, surrounded by that mocking cuckoo clock and all the uncomfortable plastic furniture. But there is laughter. How can I not laugh when I think of the moment I found out? Sitting on the floor of the nursery, amongst the blocks and the plush toys, cherubic Sam on my knee, opening that children\u2019s song book I found out later was a gift to my husband from Thelma called \u201cThe Hungry Hippo.\u201d On the first page, in lascivious handwriting: My darling. Let this be a reminder of how hungry I am for you. xoxo- Thelma. I remember the sound as I snapped the book shut. I remember Sam grabbing for it, wondering why story time was over before it had begun. I can see her when I close my eyes, hunched over that sweet and unassuming book, a hippo herself with that round, smug face, those manly teeth, that grayish skin. To be cheated on when you are seven months pregnant, by your second husband, is one thing. To be cheated on with a woman who resembles a cartoon hippo is entirely another. This, more than anything, is what makes me cry when I\u2019m alone with just my father\u2019s cuckoo clock and the rubber loveseat to keep me company.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe first day I did not think it was funny.

If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

But we were never lonely and never afraid when we were together.I know that the night is not the same as the day: that all things are different, that the things of the night cannot be explained in the day, because they do not then exist, and the night can be a dreadful time for lonely people once their loneliness has started.

It could have always been there like a mountain in the distance, and I could have not known I'd memorized it. Then she spoke. \"Do you need me tomorrow?\"\"Shush. Shush,\" I said. I didn't like that I had to say it. It was that knowledge of what not to say that filled more in me than any words could. She turned away. The rain hit thick on the balcony tiles. The sheets felt soft. I wanted her to focus on that. The sheets, the small room, the wind blowing the rain sideways. We didn't burn the lights and let the moon through the thin curtain show. In similar rooms and nights like these, I had felt the worst of them alone. What I didn't know I needed was that same stifled quiet, the same rain, the same room. Perhaps I expected less of me to fill it all. I felt at home when I felt her most and heard her least. With the crowded taverns, I'd go and sit between stone shoulders and feel no need of my being there. What made her mine was what she never asked of me.\"Maybe tomorrow,\" I said. She said nothing. The rain whipped on. Soon, the streets outside would be muddy and thick. The mud would cake our shoes. The ground at its meanest like that. It takes us at its softest. The ground breaks everyone it breaks itself for. All men, the very good and the very gentle and the very brave, all go quiet in the ground. It clings and cakes to you. Yet you can pull. Yet you can crawl and drag onto more mud, more breaking, more ground that will eventually take you.\"Maybe tomorrow you come with me,\" I still said to the rain.",

If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially. If you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you too but there will be no special hurry.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe hotel balcony looked out through the rain down to the riviera. The houses outside were gray. In the dark we listened to the rain on the roof, and Catherine turned to me to say nothing, and we lay like that for a while. The slope of her shoulder was like a mountain. It could have always been there like a mountain in the distance, and I could have not known I'd memorized it. Then she spoke. \"Do you need me tomorrow?\"\"Shush. Shush,\" I said. I didn't like that I had to say it. It was that knowledge of what not to say that filled more in me than any words could. She turned away. The rain hit thick on the balcony tiles. The sheets felt soft. I wanted her to focus on that. The sheets, the small room, the wind blowing the rain sideways. We didn't burn the lights and let the moon through the thin curtain show. In similar rooms and nights like these, I had felt the worst of them alone. What I didn't know I needed was that same stifled quiet, the same rain, the same room. Perhaps I expected less of me to fill it all. I felt at home when I felt her most and heard her least. With the crowded taverns, I'd go and sit between stone shoulders and feel no need of my being there. What made her mine was what she never asked of me.\"Maybe tomorrow,\" I said. She said nothing. The rain whipped on. Soon, the streets outside would be muddy and thick. The mud would cake our shoes. The ground at its meanest like that. It takes us at its softest. The ground breaks everyone it breaks itself for. All men, the very good and the very gentle and the very brave, all go quiet in the ground. It clings and cakes to you. Yet you can pull. Yet you can crawl and drag onto more mud, more breaking, more ground that will eventually take you.\"Maybe tomorrow you come with me,\" I still said to the rain.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

It had cost him a good deal, in money and pride, since he was not a begging man, to rent Hill House for three months, but he expected absolutely to be compensated for his pains by the sensation following upon the publication of his definitive work on the causes and effects of psychic disturbances in a house commonly known as \u2018haunted.\u2019 He had been looking for an honestly haunted house all his life. When he heard of Hill House he had been at first doubtful, then hopeful, then indefatigable; he was not the man to let go of Hill House once he had found it.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

I have found myself returning home many times over the years. There may no longer be a geographical place that bears more than a passing resemblance to the home of my girlhood, yet \u201chome\u201d itself is something inescapable and internal, a place of shadows, dreams, fears and dragons that is formed in childhood and carried deep inside for the rest of one\u2019s life. I have returned again and again to that place, an imaginative landscape mapped and defined not by geography nor by cultural differences but by our youthful perceptions, during a time when the adults in our lives\u2014parents, neighbors, siblings\u2014are but shadowy figures whose actions are an enigma to us even as they shape our very selves. Many of us will grow old without truly growing up. We may fulfill the roles demanded of us as we age, whether by paying a bill, finding a parking space, or any of those actions that comprise an adult life. We may wander to other continents and may never return to the physical houses of our pasts, if these houses even remain standing for us to visit. But we are always one moment away from retreating to this inner world. It is here where we immerse ourselves in the comforts that defined our sense of home as children, whether those comforts were real or half imagined and exaggerated by our childlike innocence. I have returned home in spirit countless times, to this inner world that is a refuge and sanctuary, a place of ultimate belonging. It is this home which keeps me whole, a place I will never fully leave.",
        "paragraph2": "Thomas Wolfe warned in the title of America\u2019s great novel that \u201cYou Can\u2019t Go Home Again.\u201d I enjoyed the book but I never agreed with the title. I believe that one can never leave home. I believe that one carries the shadows, the dreams, the fears and dragons of home under one\u2019s skin, at the extreme corners of ones eyes and possibly in the gristle of the ear lobe.Home is that youthful region where a child is the only real living inhabitant. Parents, siblings, and neighbors, are mysterious apparitions, who come, go, and do strange unfathomable things in and around the child, the region\u2019s only enfranchised citizen.Geography, as such, has little meaning to the child observer. If one grows up in the Southwest, the desert and open skies are natural. New York, with the elevators and subway rumble and millions of people, and Southeast Florida with its palm trees and sun and beaches are to the children of those regions the way the outer world is, has been, and will always be. Since the child cannot control that environment, she has to find her own place, a region where only she lives and no one else can enter.I am convinced that most people do not grow up. We find parking spaces and honor our credit cards. We marry and dare to have children and call that growing up. I think what we do is mostly grow old. We carry accumulation of years in our bodies and on our faces, but generally our real selves, the children inside, are still innocent and shy as magnolias.We may act sophisticated and worldly but I believe we feel safest when we go inside ourselves and find home, a place where we belong and maybe the only place we really do.",

There may no longer be a geographical place that bears more than a passing resemblance to the home of my girlhood, yet \u201chome\u201d itself is something inescapable and internal, a place of shadows, dreams, fears and dragons that is formed in childhood and carried deep inside for the rest of one\u2019s life. I have returned again and again to that place, an imaginative landscape mapped and defined not by geography nor by cultural differences but by our youthful perceptions, during a time when the adults in our lives\u2014parents, neighbors, siblings\u2014are but shadowy figures whose actions are an enigma to us even as they shape our very selves. Many of us will grow old without truly growing up. We may fulfill the roles demanded of us as we age, whether by paying a bill, finding a parking space, or any of those actions that comprise an adult life. We may wander to other continents and may never return to the physical houses of our pasts, if these houses even remain standing for us to visit. But we are always one moment away from retreating to this inner world. It is here where we immerse ourselves in the comforts that defined our sense of home as children, whether those comforts were real or half imagined and exaggerated by our childlike innocence. I have returned home in spirit countless times, to this inner world that is a refuge and sanctuary, a place of ultimate belonging. It is this home which keeps me whole, a place I will never fully leave.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThomas Wolfe warned in the title of America\u2019s great novel that \u201cYou Can\u2019t Go Home Again.\u201d I enjoyed the book but I never agreed with the title. I believe that one can never leave home. I believe that one carries the shadows, the dreams, the fears and dragons of home under one\u2019s skin, at the extreme corners of ones eyes and possibly in the gristle of the ear lobe.Home is that youthful region where a child is the only real living inhabitant. Parents, siblings, and neighbors, are mysterious apparitions, who come, go, and do strange unfathomable things in and around the child, the region\u2019s only enfranchised citizen.Geography, as such, has little meaning to the child observer. If one grows up in the Southwest, the desert and open skies are natural. New York, with the elevators and subway rumble and millions of people, and Southeast Florida with its palm trees and sun and beaches are to the children of those regions the way the outer world is, has been, and will always be. Since the child cannot control that environment, she has to find her own place, a region where only she lives and no one else can enter.I am convinced that most people do not grow up. We find parking spaces and honor our credit cards. We marry and dare to have children and call that growing up. I think what we do is mostly grow old. We carry accumulation of years in our bodies and on our faces, but generally our real selves, the children inside, are still innocent and shy as magnolias.We may act sophisticated and worldly but I believe we feel safest when we go inside ourselves and find home, a place where we belong and maybe the only place we really do.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

It was fitting that I found out about the job from our local drunk. Five bottles in at nine in the a.m. and the guy was babbling about being an elf for the US postal system. I'd rather have been six sheets to the wind than selling my soul for employment. And yet, I found the work to be rather freeing. I got to swan around town all day, moseying up to people's houses and eyeing their letters before dropping them off, washing my hands of them until tomorrow. It was simple, easy.I met the big woman my second day on the job. When I say big, she was actually quite short, but her tits were so massive they came up to her chin. My kind of woman. Until she opened her mouth and gave me her sad sap story. Her husband was enlisted some place far away. I couldn't tell what possibility bothered her most\u2014that he was blowing guys' heads off or that he was getting blown. She went on and on about how it wasn't right for a married woman to be all alone. The big diamond ring was apparently a cure-all. This was news to me.

It was fitting that I found out about the job from our local drunk. Five bottles in at nine in the a.m. and the guy was babbling about being an elf for the US postal system. I'd rather have been six sheets to the wind than selling my soul for employment. And yet, I found the work to be rather freeing. I got to swan around town all day, moseying up to people's houses and eyeing their letters before dropping them off, washing my hands of them until tomorrow. It was simple, easy.I met the big woman my second day on the job. When I say big, she was actually quite short, but her tits were so massive they came up to her chin. My kind of woman. Until she opened her mouth and gave me her sad sap story. Her husband was enlisted some place far away. I couldn't tell what possibility bothered her most\u2014that he was blowing guys' heads off or that he was getting blown. She went on and on about how it wasn't right for a married woman to be all alone. The big diamond ring was apparently a cure-all. This was news to me.

In the Berglunds\u2019 current life in Washington D.C., where they had moved two years prior, Walter was falling from grace. It was perhaps less like a fall and more like a plummet. An article in the New York Times had just been published, ruthlessly exposing his corrupt dealings with the coal industry.

In describing Walter, the article made generous use of words like \u201carrogant\u201d and \u201cethically compromised,\u201d which Walter\u2019s old neighbors in Ramsey Hill found difficult to process.

But my father read the entire novel. He had asked to. And when he slammed the pages onto my table, in the harsh return to the site of their creation, I was certain he would insist I write no more. I allowed myself to believe that, in the moment of silence after the table steadied, my words were so inept they could not draw near the man who best knew me. I believed this until he embraced me. I did not realize until much later, far beyond the glances of accumulated days behind me, that his momentary silence was the struggle for his own words. \u201cOne day,\u201d he eventually said. \u201cOne day, my son will be a famous author. A Nobel prize author. One day.\u201d The loose pages on the desk were an off-white bond paper, and it is these pages I have kept and oftentimes return to, long after I titled the manuscript Cevdet Bey and His Sons, long after it was sold and published, long after my relocating to a larger apartment in Istanbul and my father\u2019s passing seven years later in December, 2002.

Memories are distant, those vibrant, vivid images inevitably softened by the passing days and nights into muddy and distorted reflections. My practice of keeping time in relation to what John and I were doing last year is a game of questions. When he was alive, who did we see today? Where did we go together? Above all: What did he say to me then? Crossing Lexington Avenue in the wintry haze enveloping New York, a cold, damp curtain hung above the city, I come across the date\u2014December 31, 2003\u2014and realize John never saw this day last year. My exercise for keeping time has expired, and my husband lives in the distant past. I might transplant him here, invite him as memory into this moment to maintain our profound connection, the sort unsevered by death so long as he is kept within the perfect safety of memory. Yet it occurs to me\u2014in this exercise of resurrection, I am only ensuring that I, too, never see December 31, 2003. That I, like John, live only in my recollections. Thus: we must keep them dead. To continue living, to draw oneself up from the smudged and mildewy twilight of the place where memory is real to us, there can be no resurrection; for the living to carry on, the dead must remain dead.",

My sense of John himself, John alive, will become more remote, even \u201cmudgy,\u201d softened, transmuted into whatever best serves my life without him. In fact this is already beginning to happen. All year I have been keeping time by last year\u2019s calendar: what were we doing on this day last year, where did we have dinner, is it the day a year ago we flew to Honolulu after Quintana\u2019s wedding, is it the day a year ago we flew back from Paris, is it the day. I realized today for the first time that my memory of this day a year ago is a memory that does not involve John. This day a year ago was December 31, 2003. John did not see this day a year ago. John was dead.I was crossing Lexington Avenue when this occurred to me.I know why we try to keep the dead alive: we try to keep them alive in order to keep them with us.I also know that if we are to live ourselves there comes a point at which we must relinquish the dead, let them go, keep them dead.",

Memories are distant, those vibrant, vivid images inevitably softened by the passing days and nights into muddy and distorted reflections. My practice of keeping time in relation to what John and I were doing last year is a game of questions. When he was alive, who did we see today? Where did we go together? Above all: What did he say to me then? Crossing Lexington Avenue in the wintry haze enveloping New York, a cold, damp curtain hung above the city, I come across the date\u2014December 31, 2003\u2014and realize John never saw this day last year. My exercise for keeping time has expired, and my husband lives in the distant past. I might transplant him here, invite him as memory into this moment to maintain our profound connection, the sort unsevered by death so long as he is kept within the perfect safety of memory. Yet it occurs to me\u2014in this exercise of resurrection, I am only ensuring that I, too, never see December 31, 2003. That I, like John, live only in my recollections. Thus: we must keep them dead. To continue living, to draw oneself up from the smudged and mildewy twilight of the place where memory is real to us, there can be no resurrection; for the living to carry on, the dead must remain dead.\n\nParagraph 2:\nI did not want to finish the year because I know that as the days pass, as January becomes February and February becomes summer, certain things will happen. My image of John at the instant of his death will become less immediate, less raw. It will become something that happened in another year. My sense of John himself, John alive, will become more remote, even \u201cmudgy,\u201d softened, transmuted into whatever best serves my life without him. In fact this is already beginning to happen. All year I have been keeping time by last year\u2019s calendar: what were we doing on this day last year, where did we have dinner, is it the day a year ago we flew to Honolulu after Quintana\u2019s wedding, is it the day a year ago we flew back from Paris, is it the day.

First, he conjured a creased envelope from his shirt pocket, inside which were two crisp hundred-dollar bills, but no note, no card.

She is immensely sad on that beach and she walks up and down the shining sand alone, her bare feet in the freezing water, and when you try to hug her she says, Don\u2019t. She stares at the rocks jutting out of the water, the wind carrying her hair straight back. On the ride out to the hotel, up through those wild steeps, you pick up a pair of hitchhikers, a couple so giddy with love that you almost throw them out of the car. She says nothing. Later, in the hotel, she cries.\n\nParagraph 2:\nHow this went was, you go about your post-cheating days with your bad-ass salcedense from Salcedo, unworried about what you\u2019d done, how you\u2019d done it, who you\u2019d done it with, and for a good long while the two of you are what you might call happy. You were happy. Then out of nowhere you one day walk in on her reading your emails. The emails. Upwards of fifty women over six years she discovered, and for some reason you thought you had messaged more. No signific\u00f3 nada, you said, it was foolish, you said, and what she\u2019d said and told you over and over again over the years, she said again: that cheating was unforgivable. Prohibida. Grounds to shout, Pack your shit and go. Just go. But she stayed. Maybe it was her father\u2019s death or your failures, all those failures, that she stayed with you through, maybe it was her success in passing the bar, but in the end what bound the two of you, why she stayed as long as she did\u2013\u2013who the hell knows. After the emails you made an attempt to make good. Travelled with her everywhere from the Dominican Republic, Mexico, to New Zealand. New Zealand. There on the beach she had long dreamed of visiting, that one from The Piano, and that you thought bringing her to would fix everything, she walked on ahead, and you walked in her smaller footsteps in the sand. Mi amor, you said. Walk by my side. You are so far away. Please, she said. Just leave me alone. On the ride home, the two of you shared a cab with a laughing couple tumbling over one another, besar, holding each other\u2019s faces in their hands, and you wanted to die. Back in the hotel room she broke down for good. You never saw such tears, never felt that shame you felt then for having caused them. No more, she said to you. No mas.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

It was coming down in buckets. Even barrels. My hunting hat helped protect my hair a little, but I was soaked all the way to my bones. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever get dry. But even though I was cold and wet, I couldn\u2019t stop feeling so happy that every raindrop was like a miniature sun. I watched Phoebe laughing and waving in her blue coat. She was smiling real big, and after a little while, I realized I was smiling too. The painted horses on the carousel went up and down, and I didn\u2019t want them to ever stop. Then I ended up here, where nobody smiles like Phoebe and I\u2019m not allowed outside by myself. It doesn\u2019t rain very often around here, but when it does, I sit by the windows and remember what it felt like to stand in that crazy downpour. Then I smile just to myself, like a secret. Everybody here asks me the stupidest questions I\u2019ve ever heard. Especially that one doctor. He asked me the other day about whether I plan on applying myself when I go back to school. \u201cThat\u2019s none of your goddamn business,\u201d I said to him. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t really my business. But it\u2019s your business, isn\u2019t it? Don\u2019t you think your future deserves some consideration?\u201d I told him he was the biggest phony I\u2019d ever met in my life. It probably wasn\u2019t true, but in the moment, it sure felt like it. This doctor keeps telling me I have lots of potential and that if I don\u2019t get better, I\u2019ll waste it. I think he should worry about wasting his own potential. What kind of doctor wants to be stuck in a place like this talking to people like me? Sometimes my brother D.B. comes to visit. He\u2019s a screenwriter, and not as bad as the other people here, but he still asks lots of questions. Mostly stuff about medicine, which I don\u2019t like talking about, and television, which I\u2019m not even allowed to watch here. The last time he came, he brought along an English actress who wore lots of sparkles. She seemed nervous and kept telling me how brave I was. When she left to go to the bathroom, D.B. asked me what I thought about everything that happened. And I realized that talking about everything made me miss everyone it happened with. Even people I didn\u2019t like\u2014even Stradlater, Ackley, and Maurice. And I don\u2019t want to miss anyone anymore.",

For when does a berry break upon the tongue as sweetly as when one longs to taste it, and when is the taste refracted into so many hues and savors of ripeness and earth, and when do our senses know any thing so utterly as when we lack it? And here again is a foreshadowing\u2014the world will be made whole. For to wish for a hand on one\u2019s hair is all but to feel it. So whatever we may lose, very craving gives it back to us again. Though we dream and hardly know it, longing, like an angel, fosters us, smooths our hair, and brings us wild strawberries.Sylvie was gone. She had left without a word, or a sound. I thought she must be teasing, perhaps watching me from the woods. I pretended not to know I was alone. I could see why Sylvie thought children might come here. Any child who saw once how the gleaming water spilled to the tips of branches, and rounded and dropped and pocked the softening shadows of frost at the foot of each tree, would come to see it again.If there had been snow I would have made a statue, a woman to stand along the path, among the trees. The children would have come close, to look at her. Lot\u2019s wife was salt and barren, because she was full of loss and mourning, and looked back. But here rare flowers would gleam in her hair, and on her breast, and in her hands, and there would be children all around her, to love and marvel at her for her beauty, and to laugh at her extravagant adornments, as if they had set the flowers in her hair and thrown down all the flowers at her feet, and they would forgive her, eagerly and lavishly, for turning away, though she never asked to be forgiven. Though her hands were ice and did not touch them, she would be more than mother to them, she so calm, so still, and they such wild and orphan things.",
        "paragraph2": "I\u2019ve realized that craving and fulfillment are not connected in the way I once thought. A craving is so intense and visceral that it cannot be truly satiated by consuming the thing you want. For example, berries are always sweeter before I eat them. I wonder if that\u2019s how Eve felt in the garden after she tasted the forbidden fruit\u2014disappointed, hungry, running her tongue over her teeth in search of satisfaction. I\u2019ve been thinking about Sylvie, and how she disappeared silently into the forest and left me alone. I suspected she might be hiding somewhere, watching from a perch atop a spruce tree or huddled inside a hollow log. She liked to tease me.

I meandered around the little clearing and looked at the great towering tree trunks and their long shadows and the patches of grass poking up from the dark earth.

My statue was a radiant mother, utterly unlike the barren, remorseful wife of Lot. She was vibrant and forgiving, always surrounded by children who marveled at her quiet beauty. The children, wild vagabonds of the forest, would be drawn to her through some mysterious summons, and they would huddle before her and bask in her gentle solace. Though her frozen hands would never touch them, she would look upon them with a kindness they had never known, and their happy tears would feed the vines and flowers that had made her their home. When the children were with her, they were not orphans, but children who had been made to be loved by a mother.",

For when does a berry break upon the tongue as sweetly as when one longs to taste it, and when is the taste refracted into so many hues and savors of ripeness and earth, and when do our senses know any thing so utterly as when we lack it? And here again is a foreshadowing\u2014the world will be made whole. For to wish for a hand on one\u2019s hair is all but to feel it. So whatever we may lose, very craving gives it back to us again. Though we dream and hardly know it, longing, like an angel, fosters us, smooths our hair, and brings us wild strawberries.Sylvie was gone. She had left without a word, or a sound. I thought she must be teasing, perhaps watching me from the woods. I pretended not to know I was alone. I could see why Sylvie thought children might come here. Any child who saw once how the gleaming water spilled to the tips of branches, and rounded and dropped and pocked the softening shadows of frost at the foot of each tree, would come to see it again.If there had been snow I would have made a statue, a woman to stand along the path, among the trees. The children would have come close, to look at her. Lot\u2019s wife was salt and barren, because she was full of loss and mourning, and looked back. But here rare flowers would gleam in her hair, and on her breast, and in her hands, and there would be children all around her, to love and marvel at her for her beauty, and to laugh at her extravagant adornments, as if they had set the flowers in her hair and thrown down all the flowers at her feet, and they would forgive her, eagerly and lavishly, for turning away, though she never asked to be forgiven. Though her hands were ice and did not touch them, she would be more than mother to them, she so calm, so still, and they such wild and orphan things.\n\nParagraph 2:\nI\u2019ve realized that craving and fulfillment are not connected in the way I once thought. A craving is so intense and visceral that it cannot be truly satiated by consuming the thing you want. For example, berries are always sweeter before I eat them. I wonder if that\u2019s how Eve felt in the garden after she tasted the forbidden fruit\u2014disappointed, hungry, running her tongue over her teeth in search of satisfaction. I\u2019ve been thinking about Sylvie, and how she disappeared silently into the forest and left me alone. I suspected she might be hiding somewhere, watching from a perch atop a spruce tree or huddled inside a hollow log. She liked to tease me. I didn\u2019t want to give her the satisfaction of calling out for her, making her think I was afraid of being alone. I didn\u2019t want her to feel like she\u2019d rescued me by returning.

Within drawing-rooms they had built shelters; they had raised roofs on verandah half-walls. Fires burned on pieces of corrugated iron; bricks were the cooking stones. On the sidewalks grass had grown around rubbish from the houses, things that couldn\u2019t be used and had been thrown out: cracked squares of picture glass, fragments of upholstered chairs, mattresses that had been disembowelled for their springs, books and magazines whose pages had stuck together in solid, crinkled pads. Once Bobby saw a flattened cigarette packet, black on faded red: Belga. It recalled European holidays: as though Belgium and Europe had once lain across the water, and the lake had only been a version of the English Channel. This resort hadn\u2019t been built for tourists in Africa; it had been created by people who thought they had come to Africa to stay, and looked in a resort for a version of the things of home: a park, a pier, a waterside promenade. Now, after the troubles across the lake, after independence and the property scare, after the army mutiny, after the white exodus South and the Asian deportations, after all these deaths, the resort no longer had a function.",

The moldings decorating the fa\u00e7ade betrayed nothing either, except perhaps the usual negligence, the fine patina of dust that came over everything in Africa. But in its interior courtyards, in its once-ornate villas and lush gardens, where the Crown\u2019s servants had dealt out their decks of cards atop white tablecloths, nothing stirred. A grim silence overwhelmed the resort. The grass yellowed under termite-ridden bedframes and writing desks; around them, rags of newspaper and littered correspondences. Vague ink-stains remained on these pages; and a sentence that, ten years ago, could martial an army from one corner of the empire to another was now indecipherable. A pack of \u201cBelga\u201d cigarettes had survived free Africa, escaped the line of white and Asian refugees at the docks, the inevitable mutiny and the mutiny after that. It lay sedately on a bench. For years, its odor would not leave the wooden slats; and in its slim shape it carrie the vestiges of wet, European summers, trails of water from the pool to the bar, the rattle of ice in a tumbler, liveried black boys sweating in the corner, out of sight and at hand. There had been no native plants, no local liquors, no reminders of Africa at the resort\u2014except its conveniences. The brand of cigarettes, of course, was extinct; the company had settled into ruin when its directors left on the outbound ships. The cigarettes were manufactured, now, in the countryside, by Africans; everybody smoked, and the sky slowly turned gray.",

Within drawing-rooms they had built shelters; they had raised roofs on verandah half-walls. Fires burned on pieces of corrugated iron; bricks were the cooking stones. On the sidewalks grass had grown around rubbish from the houses, things that couldn\u2019t be used and had been thrown out: cracked squares of picture glass, fragments of upholstered chairs, mattresses that had been disembowelled for their springs, books and magazines whose pages had stuck together in solid, crinkled pads. Once Bobby saw a flattened cigarette packet, black on faded red: Belga. It recalled European holidays: as though Belgium and Europe had once lain across the water, and the lake had only been a version of the English Channel. This resort hadn\u2019t been built for tourists in Africa; it had been created by people who thought they had come to Africa to stay, and looked in a resort for a version of the things of home: a park, a pier, a waterside promenade. Now, after the troubles across the lake, after independence and the property scare, after the army mutiny, after the white exodus South and the Asian deportations, after all these deaths, the resort no longer had a function.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe forecourt wore it well\u2014time, and the fickle seasons of democracy in this place. The moldings decorating the fa\u00e7ade betrayed nothing either, except perhaps the usual negligence, the fine patina of dust that came over everything in Africa. But in its interior courtyards, in its once-ornate villas and lush gardens, where the Crown\u2019s servants had dealt out their decks of cards atop white tablecloths, nothing stirred. A grim silence overwhelmed the resort. The grass yellowed under termite-ridden bedframes and writing desks; around them, rags of newspaper and littered correspondences. Vague ink-stains remained on these pages; and a sentence that, ten years ago, could martial an army from one corner of the empire to another was now indecipherable. A pack of \u201cBelga\u201d cigarettes had survived free Africa, escaped the line of white and Asian refugees at the docks, the inevitable mutiny and the mutiny after that. It lay sedately on a bench. For years, its odor would not leave the wooden slats; and in its slim shape it carrie the vestiges of wet, European summers, trails of water from the pool to the bar, the rattle of ice in a tumbler, liveried black boys sweating in the corner, out of sight and at hand. There had been no native plants, no local liquors, no reminders of Africa at the resort\u2014except its conveniences. The brand of cigarettes, of course, was extinct; the company had settled into ruin when its directors left on the outbound ships. The cigarettes were manufactured, now, in the countryside, by Africans; everybody smoked, and the sky slowly turned gray.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

I crafted it myself.\u201d\u201cHow lovely,\u201d she\u2019d respond, her voice lax from the painkillers. \u201cHow many pockets does it have?\u201d\u201cSix,\u201d I\u2019d say. \u201cWhat material did you use to stitch it together?\u201d \u201cCowhide. It feels like a baby\u2019s cheek. Feel it,\u201d I\u2019d say. \u201cPlease, feel it.\u201dWhen she reached out to touch her finger on the belly of the bag, I\u2019d lean over and, taking my shears out, throw away the hospital linens covering her body. Then, as her hand caressed the bag\u2019s soft skin, I\u2019d cut into her chest. I\u2019d trim the strings of the heart first, the extraneous vessels and tissue that fastened it to her insides. Once it was freed, I\u2019d toss the shears aside. Then I\u2019d grasp it with my bare hand. In my palm, her heart would fit like a baseball. After it was done, I\u2019d leave, my bag in hand, alone. \u201cDr Y. from Respiratory Medicine,\u201d repeated the intercom. As another nurse shuffled past me, I clutched the bag to my chest. Its delicate construction couldn\u2019t dull the shears hidden inside. Their blades were so sharp that, when the elevator moved upward once more, they pricked me. The elevator dinged for the sixth floor.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Let\u2019s say it\u2019s a fresh berry, let\u2019s say it\u2019s like I\u2019ve been really wanting a fresh berry, plucked from a bush in the orchard, even before that berry\u2019s in my hands, it\u2019s already got a taste in my mind, I\u2019ve been building it up moment after moment until I have it in my brain like I\u2019ve already got it on my tongue, so when Sylvie tells me she picked something for me and plops it in my mouth, it\u2019s even sweeter because the sweetness confirms the foundation I\u2019ve already built for it. I don\u2019t know how to put it. Sylvie disappeared for a while, like a mouse, but then she came back. Sometimes she still goes out though, vanishes into the woods without saying anything. I think she\u2019s out there right now, watching me ruminate. I don\u2019t know what kind of solitude we can both get when we both are in each other\u2019s minds. Could it be a way of being together? A very strange way? It\u2019s beautiful out in the woods. The trees are older than I can fathom, really, old like stories can be old. I\u2019d like to put a status out there, almost like somebody would always be watching, a statue of a woman, to stand in between all those old trees, a woman in a crown of new flowers, looking only ever ahead, forward, never letting any kind of barrenness touch her, like she was the opposite of Lot\u2019s wife and all there was to her was the kind of forgiving vibrancy that children wonder at, the vibrancy that comes from a life well-lived. Even as a statue, I think they\u2019d come to her, every child that\u2019s ever felt lost-wild and orphan, and I think when they\u2019d reach out to touch her stone hands, they\u2019d find that that statue\u2019s stone was warm for them. Sometimes I wish Sylvie were warmer. There\u2019s warmth all around in all the beautiful trees and even the grasses. The problem is that trees don\u2019t feel warm when you touch their bark unless it\u2019s from the sun.",
        "paragraph2": "To crave and to have are as like as a thing and its shadow. For when does a berry break upon the tongue as sweetly as when one longs to taste it, and when is the taste refracted into so many hues and savors of ripeness and earth, and when do our senses know any thing so utterly as when we lack it? And here again is a foreshadowing\u2014the world will be made whole. For to wish for a hand on one\u2019s hair is all but to feel it. So whatever we may lose, very craving gives it back to us again. Though we dream and hardly know it, longing, like an angel, fosters us, smooths our hair, and brings us wild strawberries.Sylvie was gone. She had left without a word, or a sound. I thought she must be teasing, perhaps watching me from the woods. I pretended not to know I was alone. I could see why Sylvie thought children might come here.

        "text_input": "You are given two pararaphs of writing for a given instruction.\nYour task is to determine which paragraph is overall better in terms of writing quality.\n\nParagraph 1:\nSometimes I wonder about the difference between craving something and fulfillment. Sometimes I want something so much I feel like I\u2019m going to break open. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s a fresh berry, let\u2019s say it\u2019s like I\u2019ve been really wanting a fresh berry, plucked from a bush in the orchard, even before that berry\u2019s in my hands, it\u2019s already got a taste in my mind, I\u2019ve been building it up moment after moment until I have it in my brain like I\u2019ve already got it on my tongue, so when Sylvie tells me she picked something for me and plops it in my mouth, it\u2019s even sweeter because the sweetness confirms the foundation I\u2019ve already built for it. I don\u2019t know how to put it. Sylvie disappeared for a while, like a mouse, but then she came back. Sometimes she still goes out though, vanishes into the woods without saying anything. I think she\u2019s out there right now, watching me ruminate. I don\u2019t know what kind of solitude we can both get when we both are in each other\u2019s minds. Could it be a way of being together? A very strange way? It\u2019s beautiful out in the woods. The trees are older than I can fathom, really, old like stories can be old. I\u2019d like to put a status out there, almost like somebody would always be watching, a statue of a woman, to stand in between all those old trees, a woman in a crown of new flowers, looking only ever ahead, forward, never letting any kind of barrenness touch her, like she was the opposite of Lot\u2019s wife and all there was to her was the kind of forgiving vibrancy that children wonder at, the vibrancy that comes from a life well-lived. Even as a statue, I think they\u2019d come to her, every child that\u2019s ever felt lost-wild and orphan, and I think when they\u2019d reach out to touch her stone hands, they\u2019d find that that statue\u2019s stone was warm for them. Sometimes I wish Sylvie were warmer. There\u2019s warmth all around in all the beautiful trees and even the grasses. The problem is that trees don\u2019t feel warm when you touch their bark unless it\u2019s from the sun.\n\nParagraph 2:\nTo crave and to have are as like as a thing and its shadow. For when does a berry break upon the tongue as sweetly as when one longs to taste it, and when is the taste refracted into so many hues and savors of ripeness and earth, and when do our senses know any thing so utterly as when we lack it? And here again is a foreshadowing\u2014the world will be made whole. For to wish for a hand on one\u2019s hair is all but to feel it. So whatever we may lose, very craving gives it back to us again. Though we dream and hardly know it, longing, like an angel, fosters us, smooths our hair, and brings us wild strawberries.Sylvie was gone. She had left without a word, or a sound. I thought she must be teasing, perhaps watching me from the woods. I pretended not to know I was alone. I could see why Sylvie thought children might come here. Any child who saw once how the gleaming water spilled to the tips of branches, and rounded and dropped and pocked the softening shadows of frost at the foot of each tree, would come to see it again.If there had been snow I would have made a statue, a woman to stand along the path, among the trees. The children would have come close, to look at her. Lot\u2019s wife was salt and barren, because she was full of loss and mourning, and looked back.

The weeping would be long and drawn out, dramatic affairs, and through my vision blurred with tears I would see my father's awful furniture, everything wooden and overly embellished, and the ugliness of the space I was in would only make me cry more. Often as I cried, I would think about how my he told me about Thelma Rice. What made it all the more horrible was how utterly mundane it was. I was looking through Sam's little bookshelf for something to sing him to sleep. I was on autopilot, already thinking about what I would do after Sam fell asleep. I was not scrounging through my husband's letters, or stalking Thelma on the streets. I just pulled a book at random and flipped it open to the first page and there, in the most flowery, idiotic handwriting, a note: for the man with a mouth do a lot more than singing, love, Thelma. Disgusting, especially because it was a children's book, one that was on my son's bookshelf. Just thinking about her handwriting could make me cry for twenty minutes. To make myself feel better I would think about how ugly she was. Not very women's lib, I know, but she was my husband's mistress. And she was ugly, it was a fact. She had these bulging eyes and a veiny neck and nothing about her face was symmetrical. I would think about that and stop crying and then think about that note and the whole cycle would start all over again. In public, I put on a brave face. One night I went to dinner and at one point I said, no one wants to take out a lady who's seven months pregnant, she'll eat twice as much! It's not very funny when I write it down. When I said it, though, people laughed. Although, now I wonder if they were laughing because it was funny, or because they pitied me. I was certainly quite pitiable.",

The weeping would be long and drawn out, dramatic affairs, and through my vision blurred with tears I would see my father's awful furniture, everything wooden and overly embellished, and the ugliness of the space I was in would only make me cry more. Often as I cried, I would think about how my he told me about Thelma Rice. What made it all the more horrible was how utterly mundane it was. I was looking through Sam's little bookshelf for something to sing him to sleep. I was on autopilot, already thinking about what I would do after Sam fell asleep. I was not scrounging through my husband's letters, or stalking Thelma on the streets. I just pulled a book at random and flipped it open to the first page and there, in the most flowery, idiotic handwriting, a note: for the man with a mouth do a lot more than singing, love, Thelma. Disgusting, especially because it was a children's book, one that was on my son's bookshelf. Just thinking about her handwriting could make me cry for twenty minutes. To make myself feel better I would think about how ugly she was. Not very women's lib, I know, but she was my husband's mistress. And she was ugly, it was a fact. She had these bulging eyes and a veiny neck and nothing about her face was symmetrical. I would think about that and stop crying and then think about that note and the whole cycle would start all over again. In public, I put on a brave face. One night I went to dinner and at one point I said, no one wants to take out a lady who's seven months pregnant, she'll eat twice as much! It's not very funny when I write it down. When I said it, though, people laughed. Although, now I wonder if they were laughing because it was funny, or because they pitied me. I was certainly quite pitiable.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe first day I did not think it was funny.

He held me out in front of him and smiled. \u201cYou will succeed, my son,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will win prestigious prizes and teach somewhere.\u201d It is this memory I cling to after his death in 2002\u2014how he remained such a father to me.\n\nParagraph 2:\nTwenty-three years before my father left me his suitcase, and four years after I had decided, at the age of twenty-two, to become a novelist, and, abandoning all else, shut myself up in a room, I finished my first novel, \u201cCevdet Bey and His Sons.\u201d With trembling hands, I gave my father a typescript of the still unpublished novel, so that he could read it and tell me what he thought. I did this not only because I had confidence in his taste and his intellect; his opinion was very important to me because, unlike my mother, he had not opposed my wish to become a writer. At that point, my father was not with us, but far away. I waited impatiently for his return. When he arrived, two weeks later, I ran to open the door. My father said nothing, but he immediately threw his arms around me in a way that told me he had liked the book very much. For a while, we were plunged into the sort of awkward silence that often accompanies moments of great emotion. Then, when we had calmed down and begun to talk, my father resorted to highly charged and exaggerated language to express his confidence in me and in my first novel: he told me that one day I would win the prize that I have now received with such great happiness. He said this not because he was trying to convince me of his good opinion or to set the prize as a goal; he said it like a Turkish father, supporting his son, encouraging him by saying, \u201cOne day you\u2019ll be a pasha!\u201d For years, whenever he saw me, he would encourage me with the same words.My father died in December, 2002.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

We were leaving Hollywood and aiming vaguely for Las Vegas. We rarely consulted maps or asked for directions. We would get there. The attorney slammed another acid tab into his mouth. The car, I realized, wouldn't do at all. It was too slow and too compact. It was terrible. What we needed was a big, rumbling convertible. We stopped for a few drinks at an ugly Polynesian bar, and the attorney made some frantic calls about a new rental, demanding the respect an esquire deserves. He did it. We turned off at a rental joint to turn in our desecrated piece of crap for a nice new Stingray. The salesman haggled with us, thinking we couldn't haggle back under the grip of heinous chemicals. We also required some high-quality recording equipment, which we would find when we finally tore into Vegas. There was something we needed it for, because this was a work trip, and all our expenses were dutifully covered as long as we did the interviews. We tried to enter an electronics store, and the clerk stopped us. \"Go away,\" he said, holding the door shut. He waved a crowbar. The attorney negotiated quickly, sneaking company credit cards through the crack, and shortly after, recording equipment sat on the curb with us. We lay there, basking in the motion of our minds, when a Stingray convertible bashed into an elder across the road and left him to die.",

To relax, as it were, in the womb of the desert sun. Just roll the roof back and screw it on, grease the face with white tanning butter and move out with the music at top volume, and at least a pint of ether.Getting hold of the drugs had been no problem, but the car and the tape recorder were not easy things to round up at 6:30 on a Friday afternoon in Hollywood. I already had one car, but it was far too small and slow for desert work. We went to a Polynesian bar, where my attorney made seventeen calls before locating a convertible with adequate horsepower and proper coloring. \"Hang onto it,\" I heard him say into the phone. \"We\u2019ll be over to make the trade in thirty minutes.\" Then after a pause, he began shouting: \"What? Of course the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you\u2019re talking to?\" \"Don\u2019t take any guff from these swine,\" I said as he slammed the phone down. \"Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. We want one of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice\u2014activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.\" We made several more calls and finally located our equip\u2014ment in a store about five miles away. It was closed, but the salesman said he would wait, if we hurried. But we were de\u2014layed en route when a Stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian on Sunset Boulevard. The store was closed by the time we got there. There were people inside, but they refused to come to the double\u2014glass door until we gave it a few belts and made ourselves clear.\u201cFinally two salesmen brandishing tire irons came to the door and we managed to negotiate the sale through a tiny slit. Then they opened the door just wide enough to shove the equipment out, before slamming and locking it again. \"Now take that stuff and get the hell away from here,\" one of them shouted through the slit",

We went over a rock with a terrible chunking sound, and he didn't even wince as I turned us back toward the street and away from the cacti and boiled soil stretching endlessly around us. We were leaving Hollywood and aiming vaguely for Las Vegas. We rarely consulted maps or asked for directions. We would get there. The attorney slammed another acid tab into his mouth. The car, I realized, wouldn't do at all. It was too slow and too compact. It was terrible. What we needed was a big, rumbling convertible. We stopped for a few drinks at an ugly Polynesian bar, and the attorney made some frantic calls about a new rental, demanding the respect an esquire deserves. He did it. We turned off at a rental joint to turn in our desecrated piece of crap for a nice new Stingray. The salesman haggled with us, thinking we couldn't haggle back under the grip of heinous chemicals. We also required some high-quality recording equipment, which we would find when we finally tore into Vegas. There was something we needed it for, because this was a work trip, and all our expenses were dutifully covered as long as we did the interviews. We tried to enter an electronics store, and the clerk stopped us. \"Go away,\" he said, holding the door shut. He waved a crowbar. The attorney negotiated quickly, sneaking company credit cards through the crack, and shortly after, recording equipment sat on the curb with us. We lay there, basking in the motion of our minds, when a Stingray convertible bashed into an elder across the road and left him to die.\n\nParagraph 2:\nEvery now and then when your life gets complicated and the weasels start closing in, the only real cure is to load up on heinous chemicals and then drive like a bastard from Hollywood to Las Vegas. To relax, as it were, in the womb of the desert sun. Just roll the roof back and screw it on, grease the face with white tanning butter and move out with the music at top volume, and at least a pint of ether.Getting hold of the drugs had been no problem, but the car and the tape recorder were not easy things to round up at 6:30 on a Friday afternoon in Hollywood. I already had one car, but it was far too small and slow for desert work. We went to a Polynesian bar, where my attorney made seventeen calls before locating a convertible with adequate horsepower and proper coloring. \"Hang onto it,\" I heard him say into the phone. \"We\u2019ll be over to make the trade in thirty minutes.\" Then after a pause, he began shouting: \"What? Of course the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you\u2019re talking to?\" \"Don\u2019t take any guff from these swine,\" I said as he slammed the phone down. \"Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. We want one of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice\u2014activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.\" We made several more calls and finally located our equip\u2014ment in a store about five miles away. It was closed, but the salesman said he would wait, if we hurried. But we were de\u2014layed en route when a Stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian on Sunset Boulevard. The store was closed by the time we got there. There were people inside, but they refused to come to the double\u2014glass door until we gave it a few belts and made ourselves clear.\u201cFinally two salesmen brandishing tire irons came to the door and we managed to negotiate the sale through a tiny slit. Then they opened the door just wide enough to shove the equipment out, before slamming and locking it again. \"Now take that stuff and get the hell away from here,\" one of them shouted through the slit\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

They are not even fought. The field only reveals to man his own folly and despair, and victory is an illusion of philosophers and fools. It was propped against the collar box and I lay listening to it. Hearing it, that is. I dont suppose anybody ever deliberately listens to a watch or a clock. You dont have to. You can be oblivious to the sound for a long while, then in a second of ticking it can create in the mind unbroken the long diminishing parade of time you didn\u2019t hear. Like Father said down the long and lonely light-rays you might see Jesus walking, like. And the good Saint Francis that said Little Sister Death, that never had a sister.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe chiffon curtain like a pleated hourglass hung cinched by the dark of the sash. It stood unstirred in the limpid bedroom air. No, the empty air was preoccupied with the counting of its ceaseless age. My grandfather\u2019s watch\u2013which still belonged to my father even after his death as dogs belong to their buried owners, circling their grave and howling the premonitions my grandfather had uttered in his own bed: life being one big fever dream, all its hills and troughs in one fell swoop wrenched from under you, a dream from which you will be wrenched, and you wake in the unending dark where you take no triumphs with you, and the ceaseless hounds of timestamp flat your burial mound and the sky\u2019s days pass beyond\u2013ticked incessantly somewhere in the dark. My father talked about the dark in a similar night\u2019s stifled room. How Saint Francis welcomed Little Sister Death as the dark all around Jesus when he walked along the long and lonely light-rays. Beyond that dark is nothing but dark, that we only know dark from the little light we got. We only know time because we count it, but countless time goes unticked in the unending dark, so much time there is no before, no after, the unnumbered breezes with no curtain to shape them. No, my time is never truly had. I felt the air too thick to breathe.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

A merciful firmness the people would instantly respect.Or he could forget the whole thing, go back to being the man he\u2019d been before the first killing: a frightened, passive nobody.This thought made him sicker than the thought of another round of screaming and crunching.He leaped out of the still running red car, threw the garage door open, and, feeling alive and decisive, stood blinking in the morning sunlight, readying himself for his task.\n\nParagraph 2:\nOf course, the man thought bitterly, of course the second you killed one damned autocrat a new one popped up, like an inconvenient erection, to take his place. It was Saturday. The man was sitting in a car in his dead uncle\u2019s garage, pretending to drive. He couldn\u2019t actually drive because he wasn\u2019t on the run. The on the run part was over. Now he was simply in hiding. It was Saturday, and he\u2019d killed the old premier on Tuesday, and the new premier had come to power on Thursday, and already his administration had implemented a series of performance improvement plans for striking agricultural workers that relied heavily on murder, or, as state media called it, \u201cright-sizing the population through proactively attritionary removal policies.\u201d The man looked down at the car. It was red. Blood red. An egregious clich\u00e9. But of course blood was red. He, of all people, should know that: his nightmares were full of it. The man stared at the steering wheel. There were two choices, right or left. Right meant he kept his head down. It wouldn\u2019t be all bad. Right might mean a job, a house, a wife, at least once it was safe to assume a new identity. Right meant fear but not danger. His stomach turned. Left meant killing the new guy. Left meant assassination wasn\u2019t just something he had done; \u201cassassin\u201d would be something he was. It would mean going public. Producing soundbites. Practicing a firm, inspirational set of his jaw for the inevitable Wanted poster. The man leaped up, determined.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

She absently thanks him and gestures for Ifemelu to keep going. Blaine's face is shuttered, and Ifemelu takes another sip of wine. Distantly, she thinks she might regret this tomorrow. She opens her mouth, though, and says, \"It was like that with my ex-boyfriend, Curt.\" Blaine's lip twitches. Ifemelu says, \"He just couldn't understand.\"\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

Later that evening, before he went to bed, he said: \u201cThis is symptomatic of my condition: You\u2019re my daughter, and I\u2019m proud of you, but I have nothing to say to you.\u201d He left to get ready for bed, and then came back into the room wearing dazzling white pajamas. My mother asked me to admire his pajamas, and he stood quietly while I did. Then he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know what I will be like in the morning.\u201d After he went to bed, my mother showed me a picture of him forty years before sitting at a seminar table surrounded by students. \u201cJust look at him there!\u201d she said in distress, as though it were some sort of punishment that he had become what he was now\u2014an old man with a beaked profile like a nutcracker.\n\nParagraph 2:\nI barely recognized my father when I entered the kitchen, which was probably because he completely failed to recognize me. All my life I had felt only he knew my name. I was a stranger to everyone else, even to my mother, whose voice had repulsed me ever since I was a girl. I probably should not have said this, but I was relieved when I realized I was not the only fact of his life he forgot. \"What was I when I was?\" he asked my mother in the kitchen. She ran to the bookcase. \"You wrote this all yourself,\" she told him, extra nasally. \"It was a Bible on the Bible. A seminal take-down of anti-Semitism.\" I could tell he was not listening. Then suddenly he turned to me. Suddenly I was me again. When he said my name I returned to my skin. \"What are you?\" he asked me, and when I told him, his eyes filled with something I recognized. \"If I had any words left I'd spend them on voicing just how proud I...\" he stuttered before a long pause. \"I have nothing to say,\" he whispered. Night fell again. When he went to sleep in the kitchen I was not sure he would wake up, but my mother decided tonight was a fine time to dig up their 40-year-old wedding pictures. \"He is a gorgeous man,\" she said, then yawned the word \"was.\"\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

It's cold and wet here, and no one knows how to love, but you stay because things are working. By the time you realize you've made a mistake, you've been stained,\" Samad said. He looked at Irie, desperate to get the words out. \"You can never fully be here, be English, because you're from someplace else, but you can never go back there, either! I know I can't. I'm tainted from my time here. I can never go home. I'm from nowhere now, and I'm going nowhere.\"\n\nParagraph 2:\n\"There are no words. The one I send home comes out a pukka Englishman, white suited, silly wig lawyer. The one I keep here is fully paid-up green bow-tie-wearing fundamentalist terrorist. I sometimes wonder why I bother,\" said Samad bitterly, betraying the English inflections of twenty years in the country, \"I really do. These days, it feels to me like you make a devil\u2019s pact when you walk into this country. You hand over your passport at the check-in, you get stamped, you want to make a little money, get yourself started. but you mean to go back! Who would want to stay? Cold, wet, miserable; terrible food, dreadful newspapers \u2014 who would want to stay? In a place where you are never welcomed, only tolerated. Just tolerated. Like you are an animal finally house-trained. Who would want to stay? But you have made a devil\u2019s pact... it drags you in and suddenly you are unsuitable to return, your children are unrecognizable, you belong nowhere.\" \"Oh, that\u2019s not true, surely.\" \"And then you begin to give up the very idea of belonging. Suddenly this thing, this belonging, it seems like some long, dirty lie... and I begin to believe that birthplaces are accidents, that everything is an accident.

I can take these teases in everyday life, but when it comes to my literature, that's when the blade cuts deepest. The most recent was a slack-mouthed reviewer who wondered why my last novel, a retelling of Aeschylus, did not portray adequately, as they put it, \"the Black man's experience.\" This was no unusual comment. At a literary party, I was once told to abandon my passion for classic retellings in favor of \"true, gritty real stories of Black life.\" There were millions to be made here, an agent had said. When I refused their suggestion, telling them that all of my stories are stories of Black life, because I, a Black life, made them, they moseyed over to a performance artist, with whom they spent the rest of the evening talking about sword-swallowing. I looked at the paintings on the walls of the luxury Harlem apartment, all of Black strife, contorted faces, hands in yearning, bodies that seldom looked like bodies. Pictures of poverty worth millions. I couldn't say that I believed in race at all - I saw it merely as a construct. And yet, its grasp over me and those around me felt crushing, inevitable, real. I knew if I burned the apartment to the ground, as I felt the growing desire to do, the newspaper would not say \"Established Author Sets Party Ablaze in Fit of Misplaced Justice.\" No, it would simply say, \"Black Man Commits Arson.\" That would be how I would be remembered.",

Once, an entire basketball court stopped the game to laugh for five minutes when they heard me mutter egads after missing a shot. I can take these teases in everyday life, but when it comes to my literature, that's when the blade cuts deepest. The most recent was a slack-mouthed reviewer who wondered why my last novel, a retelling of Aeschylus, did not portray adequately, as they put it, \"the Black man's experience.\" This was no unusual comment. At a literary party, I was once told to abandon my passion for classic retellings in favor of \"true, gritty real stories of Black life.\" There were millions to be made here, an agent had said. When I refused their suggestion, telling them that all of my stories are stories of Black life, because I, a Black life, made them, they moseyed over to a performance artist, with whom they spent the rest of the evening talking about sword-swallowing. I looked at the paintings on the walls of the luxury Harlem apartment, all of Black strife, contorted faces, hands in yearning, bodies that seldom looked like bodies. Pictures of poverty worth millions. I couldn't say that I believed in race at all - I saw it merely as a construct. And yet, its grasp over me and those around me felt crushing, inevitable, real. I knew if I burned the apartment to the ground, as I felt the growing desire to do, the newspaper would not say \"Established Author Sets Party Ablaze in Fit of Misplaced Justice.\" No, it would simply say, \"Black Man Commits Arson.\" That would be how I would be remembered.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

        "paragraph2": "For seven months, thirty-one-year old Kant tried to come out. He had decided that the most optimized method would take the form of mass email, as text could be perfected, and, in these many months, perfected the text he had done: it was nearly a work of art, forthcoming without oversharing (he\u2019d received feedback from internet forums), and grammar checked. It was four sentences. He\u2019d created a listserv for the recipients: family, friends, and coworkers. After he closed his eyes, downed two shots of vodka, and hit \u201csend,\u201d he knew what was going to come to him. His colleagues would whisper about his deviant sexual activity; inevitably, he\u2019d get kicked out on the street with his box of desk supplies (a dried-up fern and a hand gripper). Not to mention his poor mother\u2014her wracking sobs, her inevitable refusal to speak to him, the prodigal son, ever again. After sending, he paced around the room, drank four additional shots, and cried in the bathroom. By the time that he\u2019d finished the anxious rigamarole, a few replies had come in, and the reality became obvious: he\u2019d been received with open-arms and heart emojis. His boss, Greg, replied: \u201cGreat for you, bud.\u201d On the phone, his parents told him that they still loved him; in fact, they\u2019d thought he might\u2019ve been\u2014well, not heterosexual. In the days after he\u2019d sent the email, he didn\u2019t feel compelled to download any apps or sit at a stool in the gay bar down the street. A part of him wished for adversity, or at least the accompanying opportunity to rise above it, but he was left with an understanding that nothing had changed, that declaration didn\u2019t always inspire action. Instead, he spent the rest of the post-coming-out year taking his lunch to-go and eating at his desk, lifting dumbbells in front of \u201cHousewives of SLC,\u201d and referring to it as \u201cThe Year of Damp Feet,\u201d meaning he went straight from the shower to the bed without toweling off.

After sending the email, he turns off his phone and spends the night vomiting from stress.But the response is unanimously supportive. His friends reply with the visible spectrum of heart emojis. His coworkers politely underreact (\u201cOh neat! Psyched for you\u201d). Kant\u2019s parents are not thrilled exactly\u2014they wish he\u2019d called them first, though he couldn\u2019t fathom doing this twice\u2014yet they are neither disapproving nor surprised. The recent legalization of gay marriage probably helped; mainly his parents want to know whether he still plans on having kids, and he says yes, just to give them something.Perversely he sort of wishes the response had been more dramatic and adverse, to give him something to overcome, forcing growth in the process, though he knows he doesn\u2019t really want that. But having tailored his life to compensate for its lack of relationships, there\u2019s nothing compelling him to act on his new freedom, and instead he\u2019s masturbating more than ever. He will recall this post-coming-out phase of his life as the Year of Damp Feet, spent forever popping into the shower to rinse off his dick and stomach.\n\nParagraph 2:\nFor seven months, thirty-one-year old Kant tried to come out. He had decided that the most optimized method would take the form of mass email, as text could be perfected, and, in these many months, perfected the text he had done: it was nearly a work of art, forthcoming without oversharing (he\u2019d received feedback from internet forums), and grammar checked. It was four sentences. He\u2019d created a listserv for the recipients: family, friends, and coworkers. After he closed his eyes, downed two shots of vodka, and hit \u201csend,\u201d he knew what was going to come to him. His colleagues would whisper about his deviant sexual activity; inevitably, he\u2019d get kicked out on the street with his box of desk supplies (a dried-up fern and a hand gripper). Not to mention his poor mother\u2014her wracking sobs, her inevitable refusal to speak to him, the prodigal son, ever again. After sending, he paced around the room, drank four additional shots, and cried in the bathroom. By the time that he\u2019d finished the anxious rigamarole, a few replies had come in, and the reality became obvious: he\u2019d been received with open-arms and heart emojis. His boss, Greg, replied: \u201cGreat for you, bud.\u201d On the phone, his parents told him that they still loved him; in fact, they\u2019d thought he might\u2019ve been\u2014well, not heterosexual. In the days after he\u2019d sent the email, he didn\u2019t feel compelled to download any apps or sit at a stool in the gay bar down the street. A part of him wished for adversity, or at least the accompanying opportunity to rise above it, but he was left with an understanding that nothing had changed, that declaration didn\u2019t always inspire action. Instead, he spent the rest of the post-coming-out year taking his lunch to-go and eating at his desk, lifting dumbbells in front of \u201cHousewives of SLC,\u201d and referring to it as \u201cThe Year of Damp Feet,\u201d meaning he went straight from the shower to the bed without toweling off. \n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

She would\u2019ve liked nothing better than to take a short rest but Jack\u2019s voice behind her kept her going. \u201cWendy,\u201d he slurred, grinning through bloody teeth, \u201ccome back here, sweetheart, so I can crush your bones like garlic cloves, what do you say?\u201d She imagined feeling a gust of wind from the swing of Jack\u2019s mallet behind her. At least the thundering of her pulse dulled the pain in her side. She turned corner after corner. Her feet barely touched the steps. The stairs seemed to stretch on endlessly. Finally, she reached the landing. She thought she had a second to breathe, when suddenly, a man\u2014or something similar to a man\u2014 burst from a door. He wore a green ghoul mask and his suit reeked of mildew. Blowing a party favor that flapped in the air like a severed tongue, he shrieked, \u201cParty time!\u201d Wendy screamed and not knowing where else to go, stumbled backwards. The man vanished as abruptly as he\u2019d appeared, slamming the door behind him. Wendy\u2019s chest heaved. She collapsed to the floor. Her eyes felt heavy, but she told herself to stay awake, to just stay awake. Beneath her trembling fingers, the carpet seemed to writhe, its pattern shifting back and forth. She heard a \u2018ding\u2019 from the elevator. Jack\u2019s footsteps followed. The mallet whistled past her shoulder, but Jack\u2019s momentum betrayed him as he crashed to the floor. Blood splattered in jagged streaks across the still shifting carpet. This was her moment. If not now, then when? Wendy got up, staggered, pain exploding in her side, and started running. Every step felt slow and heavy, as though she moved through quicksand. She imagined Jack rising behind her, unstoppable, coming closer by the second. She glanced back once, only once, before running headlong into the dark corridor.",
        "paragraph2": "Wendy risked another glance over her shoulder. Jack was on the sixth riser, clinging to the banister much as she was doing herself. He was still grinning, and dark blood oozed slowly through the grin and slipped down the line of his jaw. He bared his teeth at her.\u201cI\u2019m going to bash your brains in. Bash them right to fuck in.\u201d He struggled up another riser.Panic spurred her, and the ache in her side diminished a little. She pulled herself up as fast as she could regardless of the pain, yanking convulsively at the banister. She reached the top and threw a glance behind her.He seemed to be gaining strength rather than losing it. He was only four risers from the top, measuring the distance with the roque mallet in his left hand as he pulled himself up with his right.\u201cRight behind you,\u201d he panted through his bloody grin, as if reading her mind. \u201cRight behind you now, bitch. With your medicine.\u201d She fled stumblingly down the main corridor, hands pressed to her side.The door to one of the rooms jerked open and a man with a green ghoulmask on popped out. \u201cGreat party, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he screamed into her face, and pulled the waxed string of a party favor. There was an echoing bang and suddenly crepe streamers were drifting all around her. The man in the ghoulmask cackled and slammed back into his room. She fell forward onto the carpet, full-length. Her right side seemed to explode with pain, and she fought off the blackness of unconsciousness desperately. Dimly she could hear the elevator running again, and beneath her splayed fingers she could see that the carpet pattern appeared to move, swaying and twining sinuously.The mallet slammed down behind her and she threw herself forward, sobbing. Over her shoulder she saw Jack stumble forward, overbalance, and bring the mallet down just before he crashed to the carpet, expelling a bright splash of blood onto the nap.",

She would\u2019ve liked nothing better than to take a short rest but Jack\u2019s voice behind her kept her going. \u201cWendy,\u201d he slurred, grinning through bloody teeth, \u201ccome back here, sweetheart, so I can crush your bones like garlic cloves, what do you say?\u201d She imagined feeling a gust of wind from the swing of Jack\u2019s mallet behind her. At least the thundering of her pulse dulled the pain in her side. She turned corner after corner. Her feet barely touched the steps. The stairs seemed to stretch on endlessly. Finally, she reached the landing. She thought she had a second to breathe, when suddenly, a man\u2014or something similar to a man\u2014 burst from a door. He wore a green ghoul mask and his suit reeked of mildew. Blowing a party favor that flapped in the air like a severed tongue, he shrieked, \u201cParty time!\u201d Wendy screamed and not knowing where else to go, stumbled backwards. The man vanished as abruptly as he\u2019d appeared, slamming the door behind him. Wendy\u2019s chest heaved. She collapsed to the floor. Her eyes felt heavy, but she told herself to stay awake, to just stay awake. Beneath her trembling fingers, the carpet seemed to writhe, its pattern shifting back and forth. She heard a \u2018ding\u2019 from the elevator. Jack\u2019s footsteps followed. The mallet whistled past her shoulder, but Jack\u2019s momentum betrayed him as he crashed to the floor. Blood splattered in jagged streaks across the still shifting carpet. This was her moment. If not now, then when? Wendy got up, staggered, pain exploding in her side, and started running. Every step felt slow and heavy, as though she moved through quicksand. She imagined Jack rising behind her, unstoppable, coming closer by the second. She glanced back once, only once, before running headlong into the dark corridor.\n\nParagraph 2:\nWendy risked another glance over her shoulder. Jack was on the sixth riser, clinging to the banister much as she was doing herself. He was still grinning, and dark blood oozed slowly through the grin and slipped down the line of his jaw. He bared his teeth at her.\u201cI\u2019m going to bash your brains in. Bash them right to fuck in.\u201d He struggled up another riser.Panic spurred her, and the ache in her side diminished a little. She pulled herself up as fast as she could regardless of the pain, yanking convulsively at the banister. She reached the top and threw a glance behind her.He seemed to be gaining strength rather than losing it. He was only four risers from the top, measuring the distance with the roque mallet in his left hand as he pulled himself up with his right.\u201cRight behind you,\u201d he panted through his bloody grin, as if reading her mind. \u201cRight behind you now, bitch. With your medicine.\u201d She fled stumblingly down the main corridor, hands pressed to her side.The door to one of the rooms jerked open and a man with a green ghoulmask on popped out. \u201cGreat party, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he screamed into her face, and pulled the waxed string of a party favor. There was an echoing bang and suddenly crepe streamers were drifting all around her. The man in the ghoulmask cackled and slammed back into his room. She fell forward onto the carpet, full-length. Her right side seemed to explode with pain, and she fought off the blackness of unconsciousness desperately. Dimly she could hear the elevator running again, and beneath her splayed fingers she could see that the carpet pattern appeared to move, swaying and twining sinuously.The mallet slammed down behind her and she threw herself forward, sobbing. Over her shoulder she saw Jack stumble forward, overbalance, and bring the mallet down just before he crashed to the carpet, expelling a bright splash of blood onto the nap.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

He talked in his open-necked shirt about the new software he was developing, that could help organisations identify the employees most likely to rob and betray them in the future. We were meant to be discussing a literary magazine he was thinking of starting up: unfortunately I had to leave before we arrived at that subject.

I wondered whether in fact what he wanted now was to be a writer, with the literary magazine as his entr\u00e9e. A lot of people want to be writers: there was no reason to think you couldn\u2019t buy your way into it. This man had bought himself in, and out, of a great many things. He mentioned a scheme he was working on, to eradicate lawyers from people\u2019s personal lives. He was also developing a blueprint for a floating wind farm big enough to accommodate the entire community of people needed to service and run it: the gigantic platform could be located far out to sea, thus removing the unsightly turbines from the stretch of coast where he was hoping to pilot the proposal and where, incidentally, he owned a house. On Sundays he played drums in a rock band, just for fun. He was expecting his eleventh child, which wasn\u2019t as bad as it sounded when you considered that he and his wife had once adopted quadruplets from Guatemala. I was finding it difficult to assimilate everything I was being told. The waitresses kept bringing more things, oysters, relishes, special wines.

She smiled and looked at the rain trickle down the glass of the window, and I knew I did not need to say anything else about that.  Because she understood, unlike so many others who I've sought to find and spend time with, who I thought understood and did not, and when I tried to be together with them, our togetherness was lonelier than our solitude. With Catherine, in our togetherness we were solitary still. We held each other up and made each other feel courage in mutual independence. She kissed my cheek, and I looked up at the light on the ceiling, which was turned off, but I could see the streetlights reflect into it through the window. Just the barest bit of light there in the glass, and I thought of how fragile it all was, because this is not a world for rareness. It is a harsh world which breaks everyone, especially the very good and the very gentle and the very brave. It rises to break them all the more, and the more bravery and goodness and gentleness it is met with, the more harshness it responds with. I put my hand on Catherine's shoulder, and I felt the warmth there, and I wondered whether warmth existed because of cold or cold because of warmth. If it was a cold world, as it was a harsh one, what it meant that our bodies were warm when we lived and cold when we died. I thought there was no way to stay warm forever. No matter how long we held each other, the cold still eventually came.",

We slept when we were tired and if we woke the other one woke too so one was not alone. Often a man wishes to be alone and a girl wishes to be alone too and if they love each other they are jealous of that in each other, but I can truly say we never felt that. We could feel alone when we were together, alone against the others. It has only happened to me like that once. I have been alone while I was with many girls and that is the way that you can be most lonely. But we were never lonely and never afraid when we were together.I know that the night is not the same as the day: that all things are different, that the things of the night cannot be explained in the day, because they do not then exist, and the night can be a dreadful time for lonely people once their loneliness has started. But with Catherine there was almost no difference in the night except that it was an even better time. If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places. But those that will not break it kills. It kills the very good and the very gentle and the very brave impartially.

I remember that yearning, for something that was always about to happen and was never the same as the hands that were on us there and then, in the small of the back, or out back, in the parking lot, or in the television room with the sound turned down and only the pictures flickering over lifting flesh.We yearned for the future. How did we learn it, that talent for insatiability? It was in the air; and it was still in the air, an afterthought, as we tried to sleep, in the army cots that had been set up in rows, with spaces between so we could not talk. We had flannelette sheets, like children's, and army-issue blankets, old ones that still said U.S. We folded our clothes neatly and laid them on the stools at the ends of the beds. The lights were turned down but not out. Aunt Sara and Aunt Elizabeth patrolled; they had electric cattle prods slung on thongs from their leather belts.No guns though, even they could not be trusted with guns. Guns were for the guards, specially picked from the Angels. The guards weren't allowed inside the building except when called, and we weren't allowed out, except for our walks, twice daily, two by two around the football field, which was enclosed now by a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire.

How did we learn it, that talent for insatiability? It was in the air; and it was still in the air, an afterthought, as we tried to sleep, in the army cots that had been set up in rows, with spaces between so we could not talk. We had flannelette sheets, like children's, and army-issue blankets, old ones that still said U.S. We folded our clothes neatly and laid them on the stools at the ends of the beds. The lights were turned down but not out. Aunt Sara and Aunt Elizabeth patrolled; they had electric cattle prods slung on thongs from their leather belts.No guns though, even they could not be trusted with guns. Guns were for the guards, specially picked from the Angels. The guards weren't allowed inside the building except when called, and we weren't allowed out, except for our walks, twice daily, two by two around the football field, which was enclosed now by a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire. The Angels stood outside it with their backs to us. They were objects of fear to us, but of something else as well. If only they would look. If only we could talk to them.

It could have always been there like a mountain in the distance, and I could have not known I'd memorized it. Then she spoke. \"Do you need me tomorrow?\"\"Shush. Shush,\" I said. I didn't like that I had to say it. It was that knowledge of what not to say that filled more in me than any words could. She turned away. The rain hit thick on the balcony tiles.

In similar rooms and nights like these, I had felt the worst of them alone. What I didn't know I needed was that same stifled quiet, the same rain, the same room. Perhaps I expected less of me to fill it all. I felt at home when I felt her most and heard her least. With the crowded taverns, I'd go and sit between stone shoulders and feel no need of my being there. What made her mine was what she never asked of me.\"Maybe tomorrow,\" I said. She said nothing. The rain whipped on. Soon, the streets outside would be muddy and thick. The mud would cake our shoes. The ground at its meanest like that. It takes us at its softest. The ground breaks everyone it breaks itself for. All men, the very good and the very gentle and the very brave, all go quiet in the ground. It clings and cakes to you. Yet you can pull.

We slept when we were tired and if we woke the other one woke too so one was not alone. Often a man wishes to be alone and a girl wishes to be alone too and if they love each other they are jealous of that in each other, but I can truly say we never felt that.

But with Catherine there was almost no difference in the night except that it was an even better time. If people bring so much courage to this world the world has to kill them to break them, so of course it kills them. The world breaks every one and afterward many are strong at the broken places.

I\u2019ve come this far, I don\u2019t want to risk some stupid intervention, she said, or even a tiny disruption. I want peace.No one was to know where we were.And, for your own protection, she told me, you need to play dumb: I never told you what I was going to do, you weren\u2019t even aware that I had the drug.I had, in fact, already told one other person everything, but I did not say this.\n\nParagraph 2:\nA good friend of mine told me about her plans for death. More precisely, she told me she was planning to take matters into her own hands. I asked her what she meant by this, and she just gave me a look that said, are you going to make me spell it out for you? No, I wasn\u2019t going to make her spell it out, and she went on, saying that she had gotten quite impatient about the whole thing. She was ready, she said, and she wanted to bow out while there was still time. My friend\u2019s body had never fared well when it was invaded by illness. It also didn\u2019t fare well when it was invaded by medicine. As a teenager, she had lots of problems with headaches. Stomachaches, too, but she didn\u2019t talk about that as much. She was also allergic to many things. Of dying, she said this: I want it to feel natural, without anything getting in the way. She wouldn\u2019t say how this would happen. Just like the coming of the Lord, nobody would know until it was already here. I had two main concerns. One of them was practical\u2014if I came to stay with her and supervise her wellbeing, my mail would pile up. The other was that I found it unthinkable to ask her any direct questions. Questions like, when? Questions like, where? My friend insisted on secrecy and made me promise not to tell anyone about her plan, and especially not about her drug of choice. She said this would bring her peace and give me protection. To be honest, I did want both of those things. But sometimes I can\u2019t help myself. I told someone without even meaning to. I made him promise not to tell.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

The wine loosens her tongue and she cannot help it when she says, \"America is obsessed with race. I never realized how much until I moved here and now I can't get away from it.\" She speaks quickly, the words coming easily to her despite the many eyes now firmly fixed on her. With her captive audience, she could almost be a college professor, the kind that reminds her of cult leaders. The watching usually makes her skin crawl, but now it feels like the eyes are attached to ears that are earnestly listening. She tells them that every time she goes outside, she is acutely aware of her blackness in a way she has never experienced before. \"Because I'm so aware,\" she says, \"I'm extra-aware when I'm with a boyfriend. And it's not just me, it's everyone in an interracial relationship! You don't want your boyfriend accusing you of being too sensitive, you know? Men always call women crybabies, so you don't want him thinking you're any more emotional than he already believes. Confirmation bias! So you pretend it doesn't bother you, even though it really does. And you can't complain to anyone else about your white boyfriend, either, because there's always some old crone muttering about how, well,\" she pitches her voice for a biting mimicry. \"Interracial relationships used to be illegal, which is so infantilizing to point out! Just because things used to be worse, doesn't mean I can't be frustrated by them still being bad!\" she says, and she looks at her nice, liberal audience, and how they've all put down their forks as if eating would mean they aren't listening. They're leaning forward, watching her like a specimen under a microscope. Her hosts are chuckling to each other, but nodding along. Next to them, the poet, who has been a far quieter guest than Ifemelu, tugs at the Frenchwoman's sleeve to nervously compliment one of the side dishes. She absently thanks him and gestures for Ifemelu to keep going. Blaine's face is shuttered, and Ifemelu takes another sip of wine. Distantly, she thinks she might regret this tomorrow. She opens her mouth, though, and says, \"It was like that with my ex-boyfriend, Curt.\" Blaine's lip twitches. Ifemelu says, \"He just couldn't understand.\"",
        "paragraph2": "\"The only reason you say that race was not an issue is because you wish it was not. We all wish it was not. But it\u2019s a lie. I came from a country where race was not an issue; I did not think of myself as black and I only became black when I came to America. When you are black in America and you fall in love with a white person, race doesn\u2019t matter when you\u2019re alone together because it\u2019s just you and your love. But the minute you step outside, race matters. But we don\u2019t talk about it. We don\u2019t even tell our white partners the small things that piss us off and the things we wish they understood better, because we\u2019re worried they will say we\u2019re overreacting, or we\u2019re being too sensitive. And we don\u2019t want them to say, Look how far we\u2019ve come, just forty years ago it would have been illegal for us to even be a couple blah blah blah, because you know what we\u2019re thinking when they say that? We\u2019re thinking why the fuck should it ever have been illegal anyway? But we don\u2019t say any of this stuff.

The wine loosens her tongue and she cannot help it when she says, \"America is obsessed with race. I never realized how much until I moved here and now I can't get away from it.\" She speaks quickly, the words coming easily to her despite the many eyes now firmly fixed on her. With her captive audience, she could almost be a college professor, the kind that reminds her of cult leaders. The watching usually makes her skin crawl, but now it feels like the eyes are attached to ears that are earnestly listening. She tells them that every time she goes outside, she is acutely aware of her blackness in a way she has never experienced before. \"Because I'm so aware,\" she says, \"I'm extra-aware when I'm with a boyfriend. And it's not just me, it's everyone in an interracial relationship! You don't want your boyfriend accusing you of being too sensitive, you know? Men always call women crybabies, so you don't want him thinking you're any more emotional than he already believes. Confirmation bias! So you pretend it doesn't bother you, even though it really does. And you can't complain to anyone else about your white boyfriend, either, because there's always some old crone muttering about how, well,\" she pitches her voice for a biting mimicry. \"Interracial relationships used to be illegal, which is so infantilizing to point out! Just because things used to be worse, doesn't mean I can't be frustrated by them still being bad!\" she says, and she looks at her nice, liberal audience, and how they've all put down their forks as if eating would mean they aren't listening. They're leaning forward, watching her like a specimen under a microscope. Her hosts are chuckling to each other, but nodding along. Next to them, the poet, who has been a far quieter guest than Ifemelu, tugs at the Frenchwoman's sleeve to nervously compliment one of the side dishes. She absently thanks him and gestures for Ifemelu to keep going. Blaine's face is shuttered, and Ifemelu takes another sip of wine. Distantly, she thinks she might regret this tomorrow. She opens her mouth, though, and says, \"It was like that with my ex-boyfriend, Curt.\" Blaine's lip twitches. Ifemelu says, \"He just couldn't understand.\"\n\nParagraph 2:\n\"The only reason you say that race was not an issue is because you wish it was not. We all wish it was not. But it\u2019s a lie. I came from a country where race was not an issue; I did not think of myself as black and I only became black when I came to America. When you are black in America and you fall in love with a white person, race doesn\u2019t matter when you\u2019re alone together because it\u2019s just you and your love. But the minute you step outside, race matters. But we don\u2019t talk about it. We don\u2019t even tell our white partners the small things that piss us off and the things we wish they understood better, because we\u2019re worried they will say we\u2019re overreacting, or we\u2019re being too sensitive. And we don\u2019t want them to say, Look how far we\u2019ve come, just forty years ago it would have been illegal for us to even be a couple blah blah blah, because you know what we\u2019re thinking when they say that?

The former premier. A Nouveu Fascist, the worst kind you could be, other than a Neo-Nouveu Fascist, which was much worse.

And afterwards, the masses would flock around him chanting revolution, the city burning and a new one emerging. Yes, would be. No going back to the man he was before the Bang Alert, the man who slept soundly but never did anything besides that. So what if hearing another last scream meant never getting rid of the nightmares.

This time, if he succeeded, he would at least take some credit. Good God, yes, he would: no more silent suffering in anonymity.

His uncle's ghost had made an appearance in the man's dream last night, making woosh-whee-whooo sounds. There were also smears of blood and the sound of the last scream of the man he had killed. The former premier. A Nouveu Fascist, the worst kind you could be, other than a Neo-Nouveu Fascist, which was much worse. The dreams had started after the pull of the gun (the newest Bang Alert model, funny, because it was a silent gun) that caused the last scream of the Nouveu Fascist. And now, on his lap, the faded picture of the Neo-Nouveu Fascist, who could be the next target of the Bang Alert. Could be? Would be. Would be his next target. And afterwards, the masses would flock around him chanting revolution, the city burning and a new one emerging. Yes, would be. No going back to the man he was before the Bang Alert, the man who slept soundly but never did anything besides that. So what if hearing another last scream meant never getting rid of the nightmares. He kicked open the door of the car and stepped out, slinging the Bang Alert across his chest. Who knew what this next last scream might sound like.\n\nParagraph 2:\nOne Saturday morning, the man who had actually killed the former premier went to his dead uncle\u2019s garage, where he\u2019d hidden the red car, started it up, then sat behind the wheel, thinking. Once already, in the name of goodness, he\u2019d sullied himself with murder. Shouldn\u2019t he at least try to kill this new, even more evil, premier? Otherwise, what had it all been about?Killing the new premier would entail killing another set of unlucky diners. For him: more panic attacks, fresh nightmares. This time, if he succeeded, he would at least take some credit. Good God, yes, he would: no more silent suffering in anonymity. Afterward, he would climb up on the hood of his red car and, addressing the people, propose a new movement that would eschew violence and rule by justice and gentleness forever.

You try to touch those fingers, her waist, her shoulder, but each time she pushes you away with a hiss, the wind lashing her long dark hair against her face, turning her into someone you don\u2019t recognize. To make matters worse, you come across a couple while out for a ride together later that day, so all over each other and stupidly in love that it makes you question why you are here, why she is here, why you were both even born.

(Well, actually she\u2019s your fianc\u00e9e, but hey, in a bit it so won\u2019t matter.) She could have caught you with one sucia, she could have caught you with two, but because you\u2019re a totally batshit cuero who never empties his e-mail trash can, she caught you with fifty! Sure, over a six-year period, but still. Fifty fucking girls? God damn! Maybe if you\u2019d been engaged to a super-open-minded blanquita you could have survived it\u2014but you\u2019re not engaged to a super-open-minded blanquita. Your girl is a bad-ass salcedense who doesn\u2019t believe in open anything; in fact, the one thing she warned you about, that she swore she would never forgive, was cheating. I\u2019ll put a machete in you, she promised. And, of course, you swore you wouldn\u2019t do it. You swore you wouldn\u2019t. You swore you wouldn\u2019t.And you did.She\u2019ll stick around for a few months because you been together a long, long time. Because you\u2019ve gone through so much together\u2014her father\u2019s death, your tenure madness, her bar exam (passed on the third attempt). And because love, real love, is not so easily shed. Over a tortured six-month period you fly together to the D.R., to Mexico (for the funeral of a friend), to New Zealand. You walk the beach where they filmed \u201cThe Piano,\u201d something she\u2019s always wanted to do, and now, in penitent desperation, you give it to her. She is immensely sad on that beach and she walks up and down the shining sand alone, her bare feet in the freezing water, and when you try to hug her she says, Don\u2019t. She stares at the rocks jutting out of the water, the wind carrying her hair straight back. On the ride out to the hotel, up through those wild steeps, you pick up a pair of hitchhikers, a couple so giddy with love that you almost throw them out of the car. She says nothing. Later, in the hotel, she cries.\n\nParagraph 2:\nYou\u2019ve been cheating on your fiance, a bad-ass salcedense from the DR who by all accounts doesn\u2019t deserve it. Why? Because you\u2019re some sort of idiot hijo de cuero, but you knew that about yourself long before she found the emails. Fifty women jammed into six years\u2013it\u2019s almost impressive, when you think about it. Or maybe it\u2019s impressive when you don\u2019t think about it too much. Your chiquita certainly doesn\u2019t think it is\u2013One rule, she spits at you through the expletives, one fucking rule. If you cheated on her, she was outta there. Except she wasn\u2019t outta there\u2013she lingers for a few months, like you are a cough she can\u2019t quite shake. You\u2019ve been through so much together\u2013the death of her father, all your job problems, her rivalry and eventual defeat of the bar exam. You have history, and history doesn\u2019t just go away. Someone has to erase it out of the books, and you sure as hell aren\u2019t going to be the one to do it. And so you jet around the world to prove your love\u2013the Dominican Republic, Mexico, all the way to fucking New Zealand where, on the beach from the movie The Piano, a place she\u2019s always dreamed of going, she walks alone and barefoot on the sand in front of you, her sandals dangling from her fingers. You try to touch those fingers, her waist, her shoulder, but each time she pushes you away with a hiss, the wind lashing her long dark hair against her face, turning her into someone you don\u2019t recognize. To make matters worse, you come across a couple while out for a ride together later that day, so all over each other and stupidly in love that it makes you question why you are here, why she is here, why you were both even born. She watches their love with a thin-lipped, dead-eyed expression.

My practice of keeping time in relation to what John and I were doing last year is a game of questions. When he was alive, who did we see today? Where did we go together? Above all: What did he say to me then? Crossing Lexington Avenue in the wintry haze enveloping New York, a cold, damp curtain hung above the city, I come across the date\u2014December 31, 2003\u2014and realize John never saw this day last year. My exercise for keeping time has expired, and my husband lives in the distant past. I might transplant him here, invite him as memory into this moment to maintain our profound connection, the sort unsevered by death so long as he is kept within the perfect safety of memory. Yet it occurs to me\u2014in this exercise of resurrection, I am only ensuring that I, too, never see December 31, 2003. That I, like John, live only in my recollections. Thus: we must keep them dead. To continue living, to draw oneself up from the smudged and mildewy twilight of the place where memory is real to us, there can be no resurrection; for the living to carry on, the dead must remain dead.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

For his entire life he has so grotesquely imagined the consequences of public exposure that he\u2019s only recently, at thirty-one, stopped hedging to himself that he is bi or \u201cflexible.\u201d He pictures his mother saying she never wants to speak to him again; he imagines dying alone in an unheated tenement, though he knows this is unlikely to happen to a video-game asset designer with two degrees. Part of him had believed that as long as his proclivities resided only in his head, and sometimes on his computer, they didn\u2019t \u201ccount.\u201d Now everyone will know; his sexuality will exist as an open fact. After sending the email, he turns off his phone and spends the night vomiting from stress.But the response is unanimously supportive. His friends reply with the visible spectrum of heart emojis. His coworkers politely underreact (\u201cOh neat! Psyched for you\u201d). Kant\u2019s parents are not thrilled exactly\u2014they wish he\u2019d called them first, though he couldn\u2019t fathom doing this twice\u2014yet they are neither disapproving nor surprised. The recent legalization of gay marriage probably helped; mainly his parents want to know whether he still plans on having kids, and he says yes, just to give them something.Perversely he sort of wishes the response had been more dramatic and adverse, to give him something to overcome, forcing growth in the process, though he knows he doesn\u2019t really want that. But having tailored his life to compensate for its lack of relationships, there\u2019s nothing compelling him to act on his new freedom, and instead he\u2019s masturbating more than ever. He will recall this post-coming-out phase of his life as the Year of Damp Feet, spent forever popping into the shower to rinse off his dick and stomach.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

For me, the work could be hard, but was usually more boring than physically wearing. And Kevin complained of boredom, and of having to be sociable with a steady stream of ignorant pretentious guests who visited the Weylin house.

I joined the patients and visitors that grouped in another. The doors closed, and the elevator began its ascent. The tightly packed bodies offset the hospital's sterile smell. I had been told that I would find Rin on the sixth floor. I clutched the bag I brought for her, made heavy by the shears within. I wondered if she'd notice the care I put into making her bag the same way I noticed the care with which she used to tend her shrubs. Before her accident, she'd rise early to trim them, and I could see her from the window of my workshop. Watching her felt almost voyeuristic at first. The precision with which she used her shears excited me, reminiscent of the delicate way I stitched my handbags. We rarely spoke, but perhaps watching her in this way made me envy her. I had seen her work, but she had never seen mine. I planned to present her with the bag, one of the best I'd constructed, as a gesture of good will in hope of regaining her trust. I would politely request she accept the bag, and see if she admired it the way I admired her shrubs. Then I would remove the shears. I imagined that revealing them to her, while she was in such a helpless state from her injuries, would cause alarm.

Dr. Y from Respiratory Medicine. Please contact the pharmacy immediately.\u201d The announcement played again, but Dr. Y was apparently still missing.The elevator was crowded with doctors and nurses, and patients with drip bags of yellow liquid, but I forced my way in and pressed the button for the sixth floor. I was sure I\u2019d be able to find her room. I would pretend I was just visiting her, or I could say I wanted her to pay me for the bag. After all, I ought to get something for all my work.First, I\u2019ll apologize for the other day\u2014very humbly, in order to regain her trust. And then I\u2019ll say what I\u2019ve come to say: \u201cMaking your bag has been a very important experience for me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever have the chance to make a piece like this again. Still, I\u2019m happy you\u2019re getting the operation and won\u2019t need the bag. But I do have one final request: I\u2019d like to see it put to its intended use just once. I know it\u2019s asking a lot, but I\u2019d be very grateful. I promise I\u2019ll never bother you again, but nothing is more painful for a craftsman than knowing all his hard work was for nothing. Just this once, and I\u2019d be eternally grateful.\u201dShe\u2019ll take off her gown, and I\u2019ll fit it on her.\u201cAre you satisfied, then?\u201d she\u2019ll ask, eager to be rid of me.\u201cThank you,\u201d I\u2019ll say, but when I reach for the bag, I\u2019ll cut her heart away, too.And then it will be mine alone.The bag is in my left pocket. I tried to fold it flat, but there\u2019s a little mound in my pants. I don\u2019t think anyone will notice. The shears in my right pocket prick my thigh as I wait.The elevator chimes, the number six lights up, and the door opens.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe elevator doors opened. It was crowded, so I pushed my way inside. Doctors and nurses stood shoulder to shoulder in one corner. I joined the patients and visitors that grouped in another. The doors closed, and the elevator began its ascent. The tightly packed bodies offset the hospital's sterile smell. I had been told that I would find Rin on the sixth floor. I clutched the bag I brought for her, made heavy by the shears within. I wondered if she'd notice the care I put into making her bag the same way I noticed the care with which she used to tend her shrubs. Before her accident, she'd rise early to trim them, and I could see her from the window of my workshop. Watching her felt almost voyeuristic at first. The precision with which she used her shears excited me, reminiscent of the delicate way I stitched my handbags. We rarely spoke, but perhaps watching her in this way made me envy her.

It was a thrill that only built space produced in me, never the natural world, and only when there was an incommensurability of scale\u2014the human dimension of the windows tiny from such distance combining but not dissolving into the larger architecture of the skyline that was the expression, the material signature, of a collective person who didn\u2019t yet exist, a still-uninhabited second person plural to whom all the arts, even in their most intimate registers, were nevertheless addressed. Only an urban experience of the sublime was available to me because only then was the greatness beyond calculation the intuition of community. Bundled debt, trace amounts of antidepressants in the municipal water, the vast arterial network of traf\ufb01c, changing weather patterns of increasing severity\u2014 whenever I looked at lower Manhattan from Whitman\u2019s side of the river I resolved to become one of the artists who momentarily made bad forms of collectivity \ufb01gures of its possibility, a proprioceptive \ufb02icker in advance of the communal body. What I felt when I tried to take in the skyline\u2014and instead was taken in by it\u2014was a fullness indistinguishable from being emptied, my personality dissolving into a personhood so abstract that every atom belonging to me as good belonged to Noor, the \ufb01ction of the world rearranging itself around her. If there had been a way to say it without it sounding like presumptuous co-op nonsense, I would have wanted to tell her that discovering you are not identical with yourself even in the most disturbing and painful way still contains the glimmer, however refracted, of the world to come, where everything is the same but a little different because the past will be citable in all of its moments, including those that from our present present happened but never occurred.

Would we ever be a part of the human tangle?\n\nParagraph 2:\nI breathed in the night air that was or was not laced with anachronistic blossoms and felt the small thrill I always felt to a lesser or greater degree when I looked at Manhattan\u2019s skyline and the innumerable illuminated windows and the liquid sapphire and ruby of traf\ufb01c on the FDR Drive and the present absence of the towers. It was a thrill that only built space produced in me, never the natural world, and only when there was an incommensurability of scale\u2014the human dimension of the windows tiny from such distance combining but not dissolving into the larger architecture of the skyline that was the expression, the material signature, of a collective person who didn\u2019t yet exist, a still-uninhabited second person plural to whom all the arts, even in their most intimate registers, were nevertheless addressed. Only an urban experience of the sublime was available to me because only then was the greatness beyond calculation the intuition of community. Bundled debt, trace amounts of antidepressants in the municipal water, the vast arterial network of traf\ufb01c, changing weather patterns of increasing severity\u2014 whenever I looked at lower Manhattan from Whitman\u2019s side of the river I resolved to become one of the artists who momentarily made bad forms of collectivity \ufb01gures of its possibility, a proprioceptive \ufb02icker in advance of the communal body. What I felt when I tried to take in the skyline\u2014and instead was taken in by it\u2014was a fullness indistinguishable from being emptied, my personality dissolving into a personhood so abstract that every atom belonging to me as good belonged to Noor, the \ufb01ction of the world rearranging itself around her. If there had been a way to say it without it sounding like presumptuous co-op nonsense, I would have wanted to tell her that discovering you are not identical with yourself even in the most disturbing and painful way still contains the glimmer, however refracted, of the world to come, where everything is the same but a little different because the past will be citable in all of its moments, including those that from our present present happened but never occurred. You might have seen me sitting there on the bench that midnight, my hair matted down from the bandanna, eating an irresponsible quantity of unsulfured mango, and having, as I projected myself into the future, a mild lacrimal event.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

No, my transgressions would be more subtle - and so I would have to be on closer guard. I made a note to speak to Kevin about this. In the weeks we had been at the house, I'd notice how we'd both adjusted to our new life. I did the work of a slave with the same attitude I had done my chores as a child. Endless drudgery. Bowed heads when the white folks passed. And then dinner out back and a dreamless sleep on the floor. Meanwhile Kevin spent his days in the library; asking Tom questions about how to get out West. \"Maybe we could escape, to California,\" Kevin had said, a few nights ago. \"California's a thousand miles away,\" I said, shaking my head. \"Even if we could forge convincing freedom papers, we'd probably die of dengue fever along the way.\" I didn't add the other thing I was thinking - that it wouldn't be any better out West, where Native Americans were being slaughtered. I couldn't stand to see Kevin get that mystified look on his face. The longer we remained in the house, the more aware I became of our differences.",

I knew she was mean and vindictive, and looking for places to put her anger. She could get me whipped, or kicked out. Not for something as normal as sleeping with one's master - there were already slaves who were forced to do that. No, my transgressions would be more subtle - and so I would have to be on closer guard. I made a note to speak to Kevin about this. In the weeks we had been at the house, I'd notice how we'd both adjusted to our new life. I did the work of a slave with the same attitude I had done my chores as a child. Endless drudgery. Bowed heads when the white folks passed. And then dinner out back and a dreamless sleep on the floor. Meanwhile Kevin spent his days in the library; asking Tom questions about how to get out West. \"Maybe we could escape, to California,\" Kevin had said, a few nights ago. \"California's a thousand miles away,\" I said, shaking my head. \"Even if we could forge convincing freedom papers, we'd probably die of dengue fever along the way.\" I didn't add the other thing I was thinking - that it wouldn't be any better out West, where Native Americans were being slaughtered. I couldn't stand to see Kevin get that mystified look on his face. The longer we remained in the house, the more aware I became of our differences.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

        "paragraph1": "My life felt chaotic, and I decided the best way to deal with this would be to go on a reckless drive while indulging in loads and loads of heinous chemicals. We decided we would drive from Hollywood to Vegas, and I began to round up all my drugs\u2014mescaline, amyl, and half a jar of cocaine that I had been keeping in my coat closet for a special occasion. At the same time, I sent my attorney out to look for a decent convertible with a high-quality stereo so that we could listen to music as loud as we wanted while driving through the desert. There were a lot of false starts; for several hours my attorney spoke aggressively on the phone with several car rental agencies while we sat at a Polynesian bar, with me sneaking off occasionally to do hits of acid in the bathroom. He kept needing to demand respect from these salesmen guys who were jerking him around, which I felt completely reflected the energy of Los Angeles at the time\u2026 everyone talking over one another and wanting desperately to wring the other\u2019s neck, and yet nobody capable of listening to a single word the other is saying\u2026eventually he got it straightened out, after hanging up angrily a few times and cursing while this ugly group of veins nearly popped out of his neck, and while we drive back to my place we saw a Stingray car hit a woman crossing Sunset Boulevard\u2014she lay there, spread-eagled, and I remember thinking that this was what America had come to now, reduced to lying lifeless among the bird shit on the street. When we finally made it to the store with the audio equipment, things became even more unbearable, everything rushing down on me like a wave made from needles. Through a half-cracked open door, my attorney argued with the salespeople, who clearly wanted us out of there as quickly as possible. They held their tire irons like baseball bats, and I felt scared, but intrigued, although maybe it was the acid making me feel scared\u2026I wanted to know what would happen, and I wanted, more than anything, for the rushing feeling to stop. Back and forth and back and forth and back and forth they went, until eventually, it was over and we started our drive through the desert.",
        "paragraph2": "Every now and then when your life gets complicated and the weasels start closing in, the only real cure is to load up on heinous chemicals and then drive like a bastard from Hollywood to Las Vegas. To relax, as it were, in the womb of the desert sun. Just roll the roof back and screw it on, grease the face with white tanning butter and move out with the music at top volume, and at least a pint of ether.Getting hold of the drugs had been no problem, but the car and the tape recorder were not easy things to round up at 6:30 on a Friday afternoon in Hollywood. I already had one car, but it was far too small and slow for desert work. We went to a Polynesian bar, where my attorney made seventeen calls before locating a convertible with adequate horsepower and proper coloring. \"Hang onto it,\" I heard him say into the phone. \"We\u2019ll be over to make the trade in thirty minutes.\" Then after a pause, he began shouting: \"What? Of course the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you\u2019re talking to?\" \"Don\u2019t take any guff from these swine,\" I said as he slammed the phone down. \"Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. We want one of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice\u2014activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.\" We made several more calls and finally located our equip\u2014ment in a store about five miles away. It was closed, but the salesman said he would wait, if we hurried. But we were de\u2014layed en route when a Stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian on Sunset Boulevard. The store was closed by the time we got there. There were people inside, but they refused to come to the double\u2014glass door until we gave it a few belts and made ourselves clear.\u201cFinally two salesmen brandishing tire irons came to the door and we managed to negotiate the sale through a tiny slit. Then they opened the door just wide enough to shove the equipment out, before slamming and locking it again. \"Now take that stuff and get the hell away from here,\" one of them shouted through the slit",

We decided we would drive from Hollywood to Vegas, and I began to round up all my drugs\u2014mescaline, amyl, and half a jar of cocaine that I had been keeping in my coat closet for a special occasion. At the same time, I sent my attorney out to look for a decent convertible with a high-quality stereo so that we could listen to music as loud as we wanted while driving through the desert. There were a lot of false starts; for several hours my attorney spoke aggressively on the phone with several car rental agencies while we sat at a Polynesian bar, with me sneaking off occasionally to do hits of acid in the bathroom. He kept needing to demand respect from these salesmen guys who were jerking him around, which I felt completely reflected the energy of Los Angeles at the time\u2026 everyone talking over one another and wanting desperately to wring the other\u2019s neck, and yet nobody capable of listening to a single word the other is saying\u2026eventually he got it straightened out, after hanging up angrily a few times and cursing while this ugly group of veins nearly popped out of his neck, and while we drive back to my place we saw a Stingray car hit a woman crossing Sunset Boulevard\u2014she lay there, spread-eagled, and I remember thinking that this was what America had come to now, reduced to lying lifeless among the bird shit on the street. When we finally made it to the store with the audio equipment, things became even more unbearable, everything rushing down on me like a wave made from needles. Through a half-cracked open door, my attorney argued with the salespeople, who clearly wanted us out of there as quickly as possible. They held their tire irons like baseball bats, and I felt scared, but intrigued, although maybe it was the acid making me feel scared\u2026I wanted to know what would happen, and I wanted, more than anything, for the rushing feeling to stop. Back and forth and back and forth and back and forth they went, until eventually, it was over and we started our drive through the desert.\n\nParagraph 2:\nEvery now and then when your life gets complicated and the weasels start closing in, the only real cure is to load up on heinous chemicals and then drive like a bastard from Hollywood to Las Vegas. To relax, as it were, in the womb of the desert sun. Just roll the roof back and screw it on, grease the face with white tanning butter and move out with the music at top volume, and at least a pint of ether.Getting hold of the drugs had been no problem, but the car and the tape recorder were not easy things to round up at 6:30 on a Friday afternoon in Hollywood. I already had one car, but it was far too small and slow for desert work. We went to a Polynesian bar, where my attorney made seventeen calls before locating a convertible with adequate horsepower and proper coloring. \"Hang onto it,\" I heard him say into the phone. \"We\u2019ll be over to make the trade in thirty minutes.\" Then after a pause, he began shouting: \"What? Of course the gentleman has a major credit card! Do you realize who the fuck you\u2019re talking to?\" \"Don\u2019t take any guff from these swine,\" I said as he slammed the phone down. \"Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. We want one of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice\u2014activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.\" We made several more calls and finally located our equip\u2014ment in a store about five miles away. It was closed, but the salesman said he would wait, if we hurried. But we were de\u2014layed en route when a Stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian on Sunset Boulevard. The store was closed by the time we got there. There were people inside, but they refused to come to the double\u2014glass door until we gave it a few belts and made ourselves clear.\u201cFinally two salesmen brandishing tire irons came to the door and we managed to negotiate the sale through a tiny slit. Then they opened the door just wide enough to shove the equipment out, before slamming and locking it again. \"Now take that stuff and get the hell away from here,\" one of them shouted through the slit\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",

        "paragraph1": "There was old sex in the room and loneliness, and expectation, of something without a shape or name. I remember that yearning, for something that was always about to happen and was never the same as the hands that were on us there and then, in the small of the back, or out back, in the parking lot, or in the television room with the sound turned down and only the pictures flickering over lifting flesh.We yearned for the future. How did we learn it, that talent for insatiability? It was in the air; and it was still in the air, an afterthought, as we tried to sleep, in the army cots that had been set up in rows, with spaces between so we could not talk. We had flannelette sheets, like children's, and army-issue blankets, old ones that still said U.S. We folded our clothes neatly and laid them on the stools at the ends of the beds. The lights were turned down but not out. Aunt Sara and Aunt Elizabeth patrolled; they had electric cattle prods slung on thongs from their leather belts.No guns though, even they could not be trusted with guns. Guns were for the guards, specially picked from the Angels. The guards weren't allowed inside the building except when called, and we weren't allowed out, except for our walks, twice daily, two by two around the football field, which was enclosed now by a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire. The Angels stood outside it with their backs to us. They were objects of fear to us, but of something else as well. If only they would look. If only we could talk to them. Something could be exchanged, we thought, some deal made, some tradeoff, we still had our bodies. That was our fantasy.",
        "paragraph2": "We sit and watch Aunt Sara and Elizabeth as they walk slowly back and forth through the gymnasium, their skirts making the sound of waves as they scrape against the floor. We want to move, but we are afraid of the cattle prods, because we have seen what they do to others, the way bodies twist under them like writhing serpents, the way skin burns where the prods touched them for days after. We watch the Angels, too, guards who gaze into the distance as though they are somewhere else, far away. We imagine what it would be like to go to them, to touch their arms and their chests and their beards, to take off our clothes and show them our warm bodies, watch their faces unthaw at the sight of our soft and supple skin. We imagine a world where we beg for our freedom, for the chance to go outside, into the egg-colored sun, to step barefoot on the wet grass, to spin in the cool wind of the day. We imagine what it would be like to leave the cold, fetid horror of this place behind, let it become a memory, a vile, coppery taste at the backs of our throats. But we know better than to go to them. They are the ones with loaded guns, which they hold cradled in their arms like babies. We\u2019ve seen what has happened to the girls who dare to speak to the Angels, the heaviness of a body when it falls to the floor after it\u2019s been penetrated with a bullet, the deafening and definitive crack of the gunshot.

I remember that yearning, for something that was always about to happen and was never the same as the hands that were on us there and then, in the small of the back, or out back, in the parking lot, or in the television room with the sound turned down and only the pictures flickering over lifting flesh.We yearned for the future. How did we learn it, that talent for insatiability? It was in the air; and it was still in the air, an afterthought, as we tried to sleep, in the army cots that had been set up in rows, with spaces between so we could not talk. We had flannelette sheets, like children's, and army-issue blankets, old ones that still said U.S. We folded our clothes neatly and laid them on the stools at the ends of the beds. The lights were turned down but not out. Aunt Sara and Aunt Elizabeth patrolled; they had electric cattle prods slung on thongs from their leather belts.No guns though, even they could not be trusted with guns. Guns were for the guards, specially picked from the Angels. The guards weren't allowed inside the building except when called, and we weren't allowed out, except for our walks, twice daily, two by two around the football field, which was enclosed now by a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire. The Angels stood outside it with their backs to us. They were objects of fear to us, but of something else as well. If only they would look. If only we could talk to them. Something could be exchanged, we thought, some deal made, some tradeoff, we still had our bodies. That was our fantasy.\n\nParagraph 2:\nWe sit and watch Aunt Sara and Elizabeth as they walk slowly back and forth through the gymnasium, their skirts making the sound of waves as they scrape against the floor. We want to move, but we are afraid of the cattle prods, because we have seen what they do to others, the way bodies twist under them like writhing serpents, the way skin burns where the prods touched them for days after. We watch the Angels, too, guards who gaze into the distance as though they are somewhere else, far away. We imagine what it would be like to go to them, to touch their arms and their chests and their beards, to take off our clothes and show them our warm bodies, watch their faces unthaw at the sight of our soft and supple skin. We imagine a world where we beg for our freedom, for the chance to go outside, into the egg-colored sun, to step barefoot on the wet grass, to spin in the cool wind of the day. We imagine what it would be like to leave the cold, fetid horror of this place behind, let it become a memory, a vile, coppery taste at the backs of our throats. But we know better than to go to them. They are the ones with loaded guns, which they hold cradled in their arms like babies. We\u2019ve seen what has happened to the girls who dare to speak to the Angels, the heaviness of a body when it falls to the floor after it\u2019s been penetrated with a bullet, the deafening and definitive crack of the gunshot. For now, we sit and we watch. We stay still and we dream and we yearn. We wait and we imagine something other than the rigid darkness of today.\n\nYou must produce your answer in the following JSON format:\n{\"preference\": \"1|2\"}\n\nwhere `preference` should be \"1\" if you think Paragraph 1 is better, \"2\" if you think Paragraph 2 is better.\n",
