Tendrils of smoke curl around her as her thoughts drift to Shirley, like they always seem to lately. Memories surface - Shirley's crooked smile, her wild hair, the way her eyes crinkled when she laughed. But the good memories are fleeting, replaced by their last fight, the biting words exchanged. She can still see the hurt and anger in Shirley's eyes. The cigarette has burned down to the filter now. She stubs it out and lights another, hoping the nicotine will steady her shaking hands. Standing there, wreathed in smoke and regret, she wonders if they can ever go back to how things were. If too much has been said to salvage the fraying threads of their friendship. The thought makes her chest tighten. Crushing out the cigarette, she shoves her hands in her pockets and heads back inside, Shirley's absence an almost physical ache.\"\"\"\n",
    "initial_paragraph = \"\"\"Eli jolted awake, gasping and drenched in sweat, the echoes of the nightmare still gnawing at his mind. The room, bathed in the soft gray light of dawn, felt stifling and confining, each shadow a potential harbinger of his dream's horrors. Desperate for an anchor, he stumbled to the window, pushing it open to let the brisk morning air clear the fog from his brain. Across the way, Mrs. Dwyer, his elderly neighbor, was watering her potted plants. Her movements were a quiet dance, precise and unhurried, each step deliberate. The way she tilted each vessel toward the light seemed almost sacred. Eli watched, mesmerized by her gentle rhythm, the simple act of nurturing life. His heartbeat gradually slowed, each breath syncing with the steady stream of water. He closed his eyes, allowing himself to be lulled by the intimacy of her routine. Before he knew it, the tension from his dream was a distant memory, replaced with a calm that felt both fragile and profound.\"\"\"\n",
    "# initial_paragraph = \"\"\"Rodney, Leah, and Natalie sat around the kitchen table, each nursing a mug of coffee that had long since gone cold. Rodney leaned back in his chair, his eyes fixed on the ceiling as he listened to Leah's impassioned plea. She spoke of the environmental impact, the disruption to their quiet community, and the potential for increased traffic and noise. Natalie, ever the pragmatist, interjected with questions about the economic benefits and the possibility of improved infrastructure. Rodney remained silent, his thoughts torn between his love for the untouched beauty of their surroundings and the understanding that progress was inevitable. As the discussion grew more heated, Leah's voice took on a sharp edge, her frustration palpable in the way she gripped her mug. Natalie, unperturbed, continued to play devil's advocate, challenging Leah's arguments with a cool, measured tone. Rodney finally spoke, his voice soft but firm, suggesting a compromise—a way to work with the government to minimize the impact while still allowing for growth. Leah and Natalie exchanged glances, their expressions a mix of surprise and contemplation. The tension in the room eased slightly as they considered Rodney's words, each realizing that finding a middle ground might be the only way forward.\"\"\"\n",
