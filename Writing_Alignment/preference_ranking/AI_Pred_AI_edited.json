He started haunting libraries, consuming history books, articles, and even Menon's essays on geopolitics. Despite his efforts, confusion clouded his understanding like the haze hanging over the park. One afternoon, Menon struck up a conversation, leading Brandon into deep discussions that peeled away his presumptions. Menon’s insights juxtaposed hard realities against Brandon’s naive idealism. As layers of ignorance shed, Brandon saw himself mirrored in the marginalized voices he studied—misunderstood, underestimated.

        "postedit": "Brandon first saw Krishna Menon while jogging in the morning mist of Baldwin Park. Menon sat cross-legged near a fountain, a cotton tunic the color of the pre-dawn sky draped over his knees and a wide drum, like a giant acorn squash, in the grass beside him. That was what he noticed first. Then, Brandon remembered the harsh overhead lights of the library and Menon's essays on geopolitics, their trade-cloth cover already stained by so many hands before Brandon had found them. Morning after morning, Brandon ran through the park, breathing in the mist; as he passed Krishna Menon, his mind turned to Egypt, the state of the world, and the haze thickened. One afternoon, Menon saw him and stood. \"I saw you the other day, in the library,\" Krishna Menon began. Brandon opened his mouth but couldn't think of what to say. With a wave of his arm, Menon sat again and made space for Brandon. \"You're worried about the world? Questions come later. First, listen.\"",

        "Human-Written": "Now, after his sight of Krishna Menon in the park, he was amazed at how little he knew of the world around him. He began to read about the Egyptian crisis in the newspapers, but he didn't understand what he read. He knew too little about the background, and newspaper stories were like serials; it was necessary to know what had gone before. So he began to read about Egypt in the college library, and he floundered. It was like moving very fast and having no fixed markers to give an idea of position and speed. His ignorance seemed to widen with everything he read. He turned in the end to a cheap history of the world published during the war. This he could hardly understand. It was as with the leaflets about London in the Underground stations: the book assumed that the reader already knew about famous events. Willie thought he was swimming in ignorance, had lived without a knowledge of time. He remembered one of the things his mother's uncle used to say: that the backward had been shut out for so long from society that they knew nothing of India, nothing of the other religions, nothing even of the religion of the people of caste, whose serfs they were.",

She strapped on her wristwatch and made her way to the front door. Through the curtained glass was the smiling face of her classmate Clara, her hair newly buzzed and dyed pink. Carrie hesitated. She held the doorknob, wondering if she could pretend she wasn't home. Inside the house was solitude, was peace, and to open the door was to disrupt it. But propriety had a hold on her. Or, like her mother would say, she was simply a people pleaser. As she opened the door, Clara was already talking, asking if Carrie had heard about the new drama going on among their cohort. At that moment, Carrie realized she didn't like her classmate much. The feeling was clear inside her: her solitude was better than this person's company.",

When he ran in from his games, sometimes he drank straight from the tap in the kitchen, making a great show of his wild heat and thirst, cocking his head under the flow, letting the water soak his hair, his eyes rolling back as if he were delirious with physical effort. On her way out through the crooked archway, Carrie caught sight of her reflection in another mirror, above the Pembroke table in the hall, with its bowl of unmatched gloves left over from winter and its jug filled with silvery dried honesty. The outer front door stood open, as it always did in the daytime; the inner door was made of rippled glass. A man was leaning against the glass on the other side, his bulk blocking the light.

The empty house, hers alone, disgusted her: she sold it, against her daughter’s wishes, and moved to a two-bedroom apartment in a new building downtown. Between the house money and the monthly support payments from her ex—he was fucking his assistant and had signed these things away with the heedless joy of a rabbit sprung from a trap—she’d been given the opportunity to think carefully about what to do with the rest of her life. This quickly came to seem like torture. So she volunteered for Movin’ On Up.",

Her husband's recent diagnosis made everything feel more urgent and threatening, breaking the stability they once took for granted. Financial strains closed in—mortgage bills piled up, and their savings dwindled under medical costs. In the chaos, Bev found herself unpacking boxes at her childhood home, now brimming with a mix of her mother's old recipe cards, forgotten diaries, and unopened envelopes from charities. While sorting through her late mother's belongings, she stumbled upon a stack of letters, each addressed to a little-known local volunteer organization. The words revealed a community transformed by acts of kindness and resilience, far removed from the impersonal measurements of her past job. Drawn by the enduring impact her mother had quietly made, Bev visited the organization initially just to see what had captivated her mother's last years. However, she quickly found solace and meaning among the volunteers. She used her professional skills to improve their digital presence and aided in fundraising efforts. The decision to donate her severance package, though hefty, felt like a lifeline—not just for the organization, but for herself. It felt like finding herself again, believing that small steps could rebuild lives, including her own."

Cleotilde flung herself on the ground and began to cry. She may never have visited her father’s country, but he was convinced at that moment of her Africanness; how else would she have been able to fling herself to the ground with that perfect dramatic flourish? He wondered if her tears were for him or for herself, or for what might have been between them. She had no need to worry; the policemen barely glanced at her. It was he who felt the heaviness of the handcuffs during the drive to the police station, he who silently handed over his watch and his belt and his wallet and his phone.

It was he who had strayed, falling in love with a married Bengali woman, destroying two families in the process. The other woman was someone my parents knew, though not very well. Deborah was in her forties by then, Bonny and Sara away at college. In her shock and grief, it was my mother whom Deborah turned to, calling and weeping into the phone. Somehow, through all the years, she had continued to regard us as quasi in-laws, sending flowers when my grandparents died, and giving me a compact edition of the O.E.D. as a college-graduation present. “You knew him so well. How could he do something like this?” Deborah asked my mother. And then, “Did you know anything about it?” My mother answered truthfully that she did not. Their hearts had been broken by the same man, only my mother’s had long ago mended, and in an odd way, as my parents approached their old age, she and my father had grown fond of each other, out of habit if nothing else. I believe my absence from the house, once I left for college, had something to do with this, because over the years, when I visited, I noticed a warmth between my parents that had not been there before, a quiet teasing, a solidarity, a concern when one of them fell ill. My mother and I had also made peace; she had accepted the fact that I was not only her daughter but a child of America as well. Slowly, she accepted that I dated one American man, and then another, and then yet another, that I slept with them, and even that I lived with one though we were not married. She welcomed my boyfriends into our home and when things didn’t work out she told me I would find someone better. After years of being idle, she decided, when she turned fifty, to get a degree in library science at a nearby university.",

Despite knowing what the contents are, and of how little value, despite being aware that there’s nothing inside the bag that she wants or needs or even really likes, she won’t let go. A treacherous thought occurs to her, unbidden: her husband must in some way be at fault. It all makes sense. He forgot to lock the door when he left for work that morning, which is why some guy, some stranger, was able to waltz into their house and have a look around and help himself to a bagful of their stuff. And now, like everything else concerning the house, she’s going to have to take care of it. How dare he! Just one more pushy person trying to take advantage of her: the contractors with their ridiculous bids, the Korean dad in the Lexus who has twice cut her off in the carpool lane at school. Don’t even get her started on Anne-Marie, the simpering but secretly ruthless head of H.R., who managed to chisel away at her salary requirements until she was left with a comprehensive vision plan and three weeks’ vacation while basically working for free. Well, enough is enough. They’re not going to get away with it. She’s sick and she’s tired and she’s not going to take it anymore. Where has she heard that before? Somehow nothing in this moment feels entirely her own, from the words in her head to the sneakers braced on the floor to the hand that is holding so tightly to the bag strapped across the man’s body.",

The stub, a memento from her first date with Alex, was her lucky charm, though their relationship had long since ended. As her coworker discussed quarterly projections, Sarah's mind wandered to the unfairness of her recent performance review, where she'd been criticized for issues beyond her control. This feeling of helplessness at work seeped into every aspect of her life—her sister's constant judgment about Sarah's life choices, her landlord's refusal to fix the leaky faucet, even the barista who always seemed to get her order wrong; it all felt unfair. Sarah knew, rationally, that these frustrations weren't connected, yet she felt like the world was against her. As the meeting concluded, she realized the ticket stub had left an imprint on her palm. For a moment, she considered tossing it in the trash, but instead, she carefully tucked it back into her pocket, clinging to this fragment of a happier past despite its fading significance in her present reality."

From up on the interstate, the spectacle of modern, Southern city life and ambitious new construction where once had been a low, genteel old river city seemed particularly gruesome and unpromising and probably seemed the same to Sallie. To me, who labored in one of the tall, metal-and-glass enormities (I could actually see my office windows in Place St. Charles, small, undistinguished rectangles shining high up among countless others), it felt particularly alien to history and to my own temperament. Behind these square mirrored windows, human beings were writing and discussing and preparing cases; and on other floors were performing biopsies, CAT scans, drilling out cavities, delivering news both welcome and unwelcome to all sorts of other expectants—clients, patients, partners, spouses, children. People were in fact there waiting for me to arrive that very afternoon, anticipating news of the Brownlow-Maisonette case—where were things, how were our prospects developing, what was my over-all take on matters, and what were our hopes for a settlement (most of my \"take\" wouldn't be all that promising). In no time I'd be entering their joyless company and would've forgotten about myself here on the highway, peering out in near despair because of the fate of an insignificant little dog. Frankly, it made me feel pretty silly.",

This flexibility also makes bánh mì a blank canvas, inviting each vendor to add a personal touch, leading to a culinary experience that feels both universal and hyper-local.

        "Human-Written": "Bánh mì are, frankly, perfect sandwiches. From the baguettes (“bánh mì” literally translates to bread) to the fillings, they leave room for endless variation while remaining entirely distinct as a complete, complex Vietnamese dish. For this recipe, pork is the star: Following a brief marinade, the meat is broiled, then stuffed in a warm baguette alongside pickles, mayo, butter and a sprinkling of herbs. Ideally, it’s worth picking up the baguettes and butter from your local Vietnamese bakery or bánh mì shop (just ask; they’ll likely sell some to you). Both the pork and the pickles can be made ahead of time. Any extra cooked pork shoulder would serve as delicious leftovers when reheated alongside rice and eggs, or tossed between noodles, or folded into yet another bánh mì. Any extra pickles will hold in the fridge for several weeks — and are endlessly adaptable for later meals.",

It began with the discovery of an old, faded photograph of his grandmother tucked away in a drawer. As he held the image, he realized he couldn't recall the sound of her voice or the way her hand felt in his. The photograph, once a cherished memento, now felt like a pale imitation of the real woman. In the days that followed, Nachman found himself drawn to other photographs, both his own and those of strangers in magazines and online. He studied the faces, searching for clues to their inner lives, but the images remained stubbornly silent. It was during a chance encounter with a street musician that the pieces finally fell into place. The old man's weathered face and calloused fingers told a story that no photograph could capture. In that moment, Nachman understood that his own identity was not a static image, but a living, breathing thing, shaped by the accumulation of moments and memories. He saw himself as a product of induction, his present self-built upon the foundation of his past experiences. At the same time, he recognized the power of analogy, the way his own story was woven into the larger tapestry of human experience. With this newfound understanding, Nachman resolved to focus on creating new memories rather than clinging to old photographs, to embrace the richness of life in all its imperfect beauty.",

The hum of daily routine had been silenced, replaced by the hesitant shuffle of his father’s slippers across the hardwood floors. The kitchen, once alive with his mother's presence, now held an emptiness that gnawed at him. There was no one to fill the void with humming or the smell of baking bread. His father's retirement meant they were both home, but existing in separate orbits. Caperton's grief was a quiet thing, a reluctance to touch her belongings that still felt saturated with her essence. Sometimes, he caught his father staring out the window, his eyes flickering as if seeing ghosts. They spoke little, their conversations now driven by need rather than want, and always stopping short of what weighed most on their hearts. Nights were the hardest; the nights stretched endless and raw, revealing the depths of their solitude. Caperton felt an urge to leave, to escape the oppressive weight of absence, but also a guilt that kept him rooted. It was in the small gestures—an extra cup of coffee made for an unspoken partner, a blanket folded just so on the couch—that their love and grief intertwined, holding them both captive in a house that was both sanctuary and prison.",

He sometimes caught his father staring out the window, but they spoke little, and only out of necessity. Nights were the hardest.

        "AI-edited": "After his mother died and his father retired, Caperton felt an unfamiliar stillness in the house. The usual daily routine was gone, now replaced by the sound of his father’s slippers on the hardwood floors. The kitchen, once alive with his mother's presence, felt like a void. There was no one to fill the void with humming or the smell of baking bread. His father's retirement meant they were both home but existing in separate orbits. Caperton grieved quietly, avoiding her belongings that felt so full of her presence. Sometimes, he caught his father staring out the window, as if looking for something lost. They spoke little, their conversations now driven by need rather than want, and always stopping short of what weighed most on their hearts. Nights stretched, revealing their deep loneliness. Caperton felt an urge to leave, to escape the oppressive weight of absence, but also a guilt that kept him rooted. It was the extra cup of coffee or the neatly folded blanket on the couch that showed their shared love and grief, keeping them both in the house."

She had a right to be enraged. She was home with our son a good deal. It took a toll. You can cobble together a solid twelve minutes of unconquerable joy a day caring for a toddler. It’s just the other fourteen or fifteen hours that strip your nerves and immolate your spirit. Peg was a warrior, but she got testy when I told her that. She said she didn’t want to be a warrior.

A man our age, forty or so, was there, helping Bing up into the back seat of the van. It was our first opportunity to say hello, so we loitered in our driveway as he braced his shoulder against her, rubbing her back very tenderly as she climbed, her entire body trembling. Trying not to watch, I set my eyes on the walker, which stood alone on the sidewalk. The man got Bing seated, helped buckle her in, then jogged over to introduce himself. As we talked, Bing smiled out at us, leaning forward to see through the van’s side door. His name was Henry, he said. He was Bing’s youngest; he’d grown up there in the house beside ours and now lived in Stateline, Nevada, where he was a rock climber. I thought he looked too put-together for that, with his unwrinkled golf shirt tucked into khaki shorts, but the van, I saw, was rugged and full of gear. In that Californian way, to which I was still becoming accustomed, Henry seemed authentically pleased to meet us. He wanted to know if I played tennis. There were courts behind the high school, and he had his racket in the van. He’d come home to take Bing to the doctor, but he’d be around all weekend. Henry was well built, in easy possession of his body; he carefully and politely divided his attention between Anna and me as he spoke. I declined, with regrets. I’m pretty sedentary, I said, except for walks in the woods, things like that. Sure, he said, no problem. When Anna called out to Bing to say that she’d raised a very nice son, Bing responded warmly in Chinese from the back of the van. Before we left, Henry asked if we might exchange numbers. His father had died last year, his brother lived in Denver and his sister in New York, and his mother was stubborn about her independence. It would be a comfort to know that there was someone just next door.",

But, since getting back, he’d spent every day at his office at the university, even though it wasn’t term time, saying that he needed absolute concentration to work on the book he was writing. Robyn didn’t seem to miss him. She looked bemused when Valerie called him her daddy, as if she hardly recognized him by that name; she’d been only three or four when he’d moved out. Valerie didn’t ask Gil what he’d talked about with his daughter on the long car journey: perhaps they’d driven the whole way in silence. Or perhaps he’d questioned Robyn about her mother, or ranted on about her, or talked about his work. Sometimes in the evenings he talked to Valerie for hours about university politics or other historians he envied or resented—or even about the Civil War or the Long Parliament or the idea of the state—without noticing that she wasn’t listening, that she was thinking about new curtains or counting the stitches in her knitting. He might have found fatherhood easier, Valerie thought, if his daughter had been pretty. Moodily, after Robyn had gone to bed, Gil wondered aloud whether she was even his. “Who knows, with the Great Whore of Marylebone putting it about like there’s no tomorrow? The child’s half feral. She doesn’t look anything like me. Is she normal? Do they even send her to school? I think she’s backward. A little bit simple, stunted. No surprise, growing up in that sink of iniquity. God only knows what she’s seen.”",

They pressed a gun to her head, shoved her out of the car, and drove it to the Faculty of Engineering, where they shot three boys who were coming out of the building. It was noon. I was in a class nearby, and when we heard the shots our lecturer was the first to run out the door. There was loud screaming, and suddenly the stairwells were packed with scrambling students unsure where to run. Outside, the bodies lay on the lawn. The Mercedes had already screeched away. Many students hastily packed their bags, and okada drivers charged twice the usual fare to take them to the motor park to get on a bus. The vice-chancellor announced that all evening classes would be cancelled and everyone had to stay indoors after 9 P.M. This did not make much sense to me, since the shooting had happened in sparkling daylight, and perhaps it did not make sense to Nnamabia, either, because the first night of the curfew he didn’t come home. I assumed that he had spent the night at a friend’s; he did not always come home anyway. But the next morning a security man came to tell my parents that Nnamabia had been arrested at a bar with some cult boys and was at the police station. My mother screamed, “Ekwuzikwana! Don’t say that!” My father calmly thanked the security man. We drove to the police station in town, and there a constable chewing on the tip of a dirty pen said, “You mean those cult boys arrested last night? They have been taken to Enugu. Very serious case! We must stop this cult business once and for all!”",

The frigid water was paralyzing for a moment. She froze in shock, and her friends on land were briefly terrified. But as Sarah surfaced, laughing and gasping, something shifted in the group's dynamic. Sarah was the pioneer. They each took turns diving in, and the ice-cold water brought them to themselves in a new way. Some realized the fears they carried with them weren't as unmanageable as they believed. Others remembered the happiness they'd always had in childhood through discovery, through realizing there was always the possibility of something new around the corner of life. Newly emboldened, they agreed to do it again, year after year, a ritual that marked time's passing. As they aged, got married, and had children, the river swim evolved into a rite of passage for their families. The consequences of that first dive would resonate through the years. The shy, ginger youths became bold and resilient members of their community for the rest of their lives. Hearing something of this, Sarah's granddaughter asked for the rest of the story.

Lou has heard of very cold water causing heart attacks, and feels responsible, having led everyone here. As they’re mulling over the safety of submerging, Tim Breezely suddenly strips off his clothes and dives from a log, buck naked. The smash of cold stops his breathing; he has a brief blackout sensation of death. But when he surfaces, howling, what has died is his sorrow—he’s left it on the river bottom. Freedom! Joy! Tim Breezely will soon divorce—they’ll all divorce—everyone will divorce. An entire generation will throw off the fetters of rote commitment in favor of invention, hope—and we, their children, will try to locate the moment we lost them and worry that it was our fault. Tim Breezely will become a dedicated jogger before anyone jogs without being chased. He’ll write books about exercise and mental health that will make him a household name, and will receive thousands of letters from people whose lives he has transformed, even saved.",

        "AI-edited": "During their annual camping trip, a group of friends in their late twenties gathered at the edge of an icy mountain river. They had talked about swimming in it for years but always found excuses not to. Sarah, typically the most cautious, shocked everyone by diving in first. The cold water shocked her, and for a moment, her friends feared for her safety. But as Sarah surfaced, laughing and gasping, the air crackled with newfound energy and possibility. One by one, they joined her, each experiencing a personal revelation in the icy current. Tom felt his chronic anxiety melt away, while Lisa confronted her fear of deep water. Mark, always the cynic, found himself grinning uncontrollably, and quiet Amy let out a triumphant whoop. Each person experienced something different in the water. The act of swimming in the cold river became a yearly tradition, a symbol of their friendship and shared experiences. As they aged, got married, and had children, the river swim evolved into a rite of passage for their families. The group became known for their resilience and zest for life. Sarah's granddaughter would later ask about the tradition's origins, sparking discussions on bravery, friendship, and life's surprising turns."

The porch light flickers as if recognizing the moment, casting their faces in shades of amber and shadow. Her voice is heavy with unspoken thoughts. Anthony responds with a nod, his eyes lingering on hers just a second longer than necessary, holding a shared understanding. In that shared stillness, the unspoken hangs in the air, clear but unnamed. She turns toward the door, her steps measured and deliberate, while his presence lingers in the dim light. As she closes the door softly, the thud seems to echo the words left unsaid."

Paris was linked with the memory of the man she had left behind. She could still picture him standing by the Seine, the evening sun casting soft shadows on his face, his eyes holding that look of quiet understanding. They had parted ways with an unspoken understanding. Every letter he'd sent smelled faintly of lavender. Her fingers traced the edge of the envelope she had kept, unopened, for years—an unopened message from the past. She wasn’t sure what she would find, or if Paris would still be there, waiting. But even now, miles away from those moments, the silence between them seemed to promise more than their final words ever could."

I’d have never felt the way it feels when everyone you know volunteers to drive at an illegal speed to retrieve a pair of pants and a piece of paper. I’d have never known what a Biblical-times sheepherder might look like in teal, or that important piece of information about my old friend. And I wouldn’t have been so distracted by getting those god damned bobby pins in my hair that I didn’t realize the rain had stopped and Mr. Sugar had discreetly enlisted our guests to carry one hundred white wooden chairs a quarter mile, from the terrible library basement back to the grassy spot on the banks of the beautiful river, where I hoped to marry him in the sunlight and did.",

Such a great invention, she’d said on the phone that day. Do they still make them or was it just a nineties thing? I told her that the only two people I’d seen rocking fanny packs in the past ten years had been jazz musicians. Well, they know what’s up, I guess. It’s perfect for a night about town. Could carry cigarettes, Mace . . . even a short novel, maybe? For the subway ride? I told her she could keep the fanny pack, because that seemed to be the reason she’d brought the whole matter up, and she’d been wearing it ever since. She didn’t walk around conspicuously sporting the fanny pack (That’s how you get mugged, she said) but concealed it under her sweaters. After her fall, she started wearing ample sweaters, not the lousy kind you see on depressive people but sweaters of well-shaped ampleness, made of pretty wools.

        "Human-Written": "It rained the following days, and the schoolyard remained deserted. That Sunday, their Instructress told Bragonzi that there was a surprise in store for him, his dad had come from Milan to see him, he was to run and get dressed, chop-chop! His dad took him to a restaurant and then to the movies to see a Lemmy Caution film, after which they strolled around the port looking at the ships. Toward evening they got in a taxi, but instead of giving the school’s address his father said, “To the train station.” Bragonzi didn’t ask any questions, and he kept silent even in the baggage room, where his father reclaimed a big black bag. They returned to the school in another taxi, and only when they were in front of the gate, with the taxi-driver waiting to head back to the station, did his father crouch down and open it. The first thing to emerge was an issue of Soldino, but already Bragonzi had started to tremble; then came a stick of modelling clay and a little puzzle, and meanwhile the rustling of cellophane could be heard underneath; then there was a balsa-wood model-airplane kit; and then, finally, that transparent bag, which his father gave to him after making him wait longer than for the other presents, as he smiled back in silence and hoped that his tremors weren’t visible. “Thank you,” he said, and he wanted to add something else, but while he was thinking about what this should be his dad had already got back in the taxi. And so Bragonzi hid everything under his raincoat and ran to the dormitory. It was past the hour when boys needed to come back from any outings “already fed,” for the rules barred these temporary escapees from joining the others in the refectory during meals (his father didn’t know this, since Bragonzi had never been brave enough to tell him), and so there was no one around. After putting the other presents in his closet, Bragonzi sat on the bed with the see-through bag on his knees. It was closed with a thin red drawstring and, in addition to the ball, contained the pump and the needle for inflating it, as well as a little box of wax and a small felt cloth with zigzag edges for polishing: once opened, the bag released a delightful leathery aroma, which reminded Bragonzi of the smell of his nicest pair of shoes. The pump was icy cold, the ball less so. He stuck the needle into its valve and began to inflate it with care: some of the air in this room, he thought, is going to end up inside there, and it will never come out again. When every last pentagon had popped out convexly, he removed the needle. He spread his thighs slightly apart to better hold the ball, not wanting it to touch the floor. It was magnificent, a Derbystar “Deliciae Platearum,” even more beautiful than Best’s “World Cup” ball; he couldn’t imagine how hard his father must have had to look before finding it, or how much he had paid for it, its white just slightly pearlier than the rest, with iridescent reflections, and black pentagons framed by a subtle red outline, and a little yellow star right underneath its brand name, a ball even Rivera would kick cautiously, truly like nothing he had ever seen before . . . He fondled it awhile with his fingertips and slid it against his cheeks to take in its smoothness, decided to give it a few more pumps, then went back to caressing it. He looked at the clock: before long, the other boys would all be coming back upstairs, he had to be quick. He put the pump and the bag in the closet, and went down to the atrium with the “Deliciae Platearum” under his arm. From there, he passed through the television lounge before skirting the refectory, crouching down beneath the windows so as not to be spotted by the diners; at the end of the hallway, the door to the schoolyard was open—the Instructresses liked to take a stroll right after dinnertime.",

It was one of those promises made for not keeping, similar to the solo trip to Antarctica that Bella had sometimes imagined when things were going wrong in her marriages. But China, not as far-fetched as Antarctica, had become much closer when Peter started dating Adrian, a French-Canadian whose great-grandfather had been among the Chinese laborers who collected bodies and dug graves on the Western Front in 1918. Adrian was a writer, and he was working on “a multigenerational and intercontinental epic” based on his family history, and during the past two weeks the three of them had toured a number of towns on the East China Sea, sifting through local archives, tracing the untraceable.

His eyes, keen and vigilant, scanned the overhead monitors before settling on a woman impatiently adjusting her scarf. He noted the weary slump of a businessman and the eyes of a child tracing patterns in the tiles. As he approached the coffee stand, he noticed a young couple near the seating area. They were absorbed in each other, faces close, speaking in low, urgent tones. One of their hands was intertwined while the other gestured animatedly. Patrick paused, covertly observing them. He wondered if he had ever experienced that fierce intensity with anyone. As he took a sip of his coffee, he wondered further: what was their story? He turned away, with a blend of curiosity and wistfulness."

Close to the end of the war, he’d been transferred to a new crew, and within a couple of weeks his old crew, the men he’d flown with so many times, were shot down and lost.

It had begun with the birth of Conrad, eased off a bit after he got to his second birthday, then got much worse when she was pregnant with Joshua, and worse still after he was born. Joshua was now three years old and Arabella was as cross with her husband as she had ever been. The shorthand term for what she felt was “competitive tiredness.” She felt she was so tired that she could not think or see straight; she felt that she began the day tired, thanks to the broken and shallow sleep she had been having for, literally, years now, and got more tired as the day wore on, and that there were times when she was running on, as she put it, “sheer adrenaline”; but that when her husband came home from work he had the temerity to act as if he were the one making all the effort, as if he were the one who had the right to sigh and put his feet up and talk about what a tiring day he’d had! As for weekends, in some ways they were even worse. Sheila, the Australian weekend nanny, was very helpful (though she was no Pilar—for one thing, she couldn’t drive), but there was still masses to do, and her husband did very little of it. He didn’t cook, except showoff barbecues on the occasional summer weekend at his silly boy-toy gas grill, and he didn’t wash clothes or iron them or sweep the floor or, hardly at all, play with the children. Arabella did not do those things, either, not much, but that did not mean that she went through life acting as if they did not exist, and it was this obliviousness that drove her so nuts.",

        "Human-Written": "Walking at dusk through the long meadow, recording this prose poem on my phone, that’s my job, as old as soldiery, the hills, the soldered hills where current flows, green current. When you are finished recording, your lips are dried flowers. The trees are full of black plastic bags and hornets’ nests but not significance; the task of imbuing them falls to me. And it’s me, Ben, just calling to check in. I’m on the way to pick Marcela up from day care and just wanted to hear about your trip. I’m sure it must have been hard seeing him like that. Anyway, I love you and I’m here. Give me a call when you can. I’ll be around until the late nineteenth century, when carved wood gives way to polished steel, especially in lake surfaces. You know how you sometimes realize it has been raining only when it stops, silence falling on the roof, forming rivulets on the glass? This is the religious equivalent of that, especially in music and applied fields, long meadows. Overwintering queens make wonderful pets, just don’t expect them to understand your writing, how you’ve rearranged the stresses to sponsor feelings in advance of the collective subject who might feel them, good work if you can get it, and you can’t, nobody can, that’s why the discipline is in crisis, this cut-flower business, applied folds, false equivalence. I remember when I interviewed for this position. I was wearing a Regency trimmed velvet tailcoat with a small hole over the left breast where the lead ball had entered one of my great-grandfather’s five heartlike structures. I met the committee at a Hyatt. The room had migraine carpet; a conventional river scene hung above the bed. After the usual pleasantries, the chairperson requested that I sing, and soon the painted water began to flow. It’s hard to believe that was more than two hundred years ago, when people still got dressed up for air travel and children were expected to absorb light in their super-black feathers, making contour disappear. They probably evolved to startle predators, make us seem deep, so that, when they least expected it, we could cast their underground nests with molten aluminum, sell them online as sculpture. But if you’ve ever seen a dendritic pattern in a frozen pond, lightning captured in hard plastic, or the delicate venation of an insect’s wing (the fourth vein of the wing is called the media), then you’ve probably felt that a spirit is at work in the world, or was, and that making it visible is the artist’s task, or was. I am resolved to admire all elaborate silvery pathways, no matter where I find them, that’s why I’m calling. I’m sitting in Grand Army Plaza by the fountain, which they’ve shut off until the spring, when it will again give sensuous expression to our freedom. In other words, I’m at work, realigning and interlocking barbules, lubricating what are essentially dead structures with a fatty oil I’ve developed for that purpose, thinking of you, holding you in my thoughts like fireflies in glass, cold to the touch, green current. You just can’t blame yourself. The last time I saw him we had dinner in Fort Greene and he was cracking me up with his impressions, especially of John. He was drinking, but not too much: one cocktail, white wine. The only weird moment was when I had to look at my phone because I was getting a lot of texts and wanted to make sure everything was O.K. with the girls. He kind of freaked out about it: Am I boring you? Do you need to make a call? But I apologized and we moved on. What reassured me most was how excited he was about the new job, even if it didn’t pay much. They were going to let him use the 3-D printers for some of his own stuff and he was really psyched about that. Anyway, I love you and I’m here. I’ve got to get Marcela now but tonight I’m around, promoting syllables, trying to avoid the twin traps of mere procedure and sentimentalism, ingesting around seventeen milligrams, blunt-toothed leaves in motion lights, signifying nothing but holding a place. Lately my daughters have been asking what I do when they’re at school; I want to say that I enchant the ferryman with my playing so that lost pets may return, that the magnet tiles arrange themselves into complex hexagonal structures at my song, but they know I’m not the musical one, that I describe the music of others, capture it in hard plastic. With the profits, I purchase an entrapping foam that coats the nest for a complete kill and a pendant that resembles a tiny abacus of pearls, responsibly sourced. What does a normal day look like for you? For me, the fruit is undefined around the edges and the faces of some friends are mere suggestions while others observe the standard codes of verisimilitude in a way that feels increasingly affected; why appear vividly when it’s dusk, has been dusk for ages? I don’t know if oysters can feel pain, can’t even know if other humans do, although I recognize what philosophers call “pain behavior” among my loved ones as the seasons change. Tie their stems together with unflavored dental floss and hang them upside down, but display them away from windows or they’ll fade, polished steel gives way to painted water, a turn of phase, a change of phrase, the slippages release small energy and the harvest falls to me. Someday I’d like to bring my daughters to work, but not today. Today is cut-glass flowers reinforced internally with wire, a vibration-control system, the religious equivalent of that, lampwork they’re too young to understand, the effects too mild. Their nests are paper, they can discriminate between fragments of foreign and natal comb, the interests between workers and their queen diverge, those are the three prerequisites for song, for the formation of singers who will eat both meat and nectar, which they feed to larvae on the bus ride home. Marcela pulls the yellow stop-request cord, but never hard enough, so you have to help without her knowing, say “Great job.” Say “Great job” to the sensible world if you want to encourage reënchantment, keep the trees in touch with their strengths, the magnolia’s increasing northern range, for instance, soon to be cold-hardy beyond zone four. The way we say of our children “they went down” to mean they fell asleep, that makes me glass, soft glass bending in long meadows, a fallacy each generation reinvents and disavows, reinvents and disavows, a rocking motion. Otherwise you’re mixing pills and gin and your friends are debating whether it constitutes a true attempt, recklessness, a cry for help, before deciding it makes no difference, it’s pain behavior, he has to be checked in, monitored, sponsored, set to music. Anyway, the girls are down and I can talk. I’m just clicking on things in bed, a review by a man named Baskin, who says I have no feelings and hate art. Through the blinds I can see the blue tip of the neighbor’s vape pen signalling in the dark, cold firefly. The raccoons are descending from their nests in foreclosed attics to roam the streets of Kensington; we moved last summer, have a guest room now, come visit. I can’t believe I haven’t seen you since his wedding. ♦",

You could cup your hands and hold Tony when we got him, but he grew up in one summer and went to work and we taught him “down,” “here,” “come by,” “way to me,” and “hold ’em,” all in one year or less, ’cause Tony would just stay on his belly and study you with his eyes until he knew exactly what you wanted. Tony helped us gather, mother up pairs, and separate bulls, and he lived in the house for many a good year and kept us entertained with all his tricks. Finally, Tony grew old and died. We didn’t take it so good, especially the old sumbitch, who said he couldn’t foresee enough summers for another dog. Plus that was the year he couldn’t get on a horse no more and he wasn’t about to work no stock dog afoot. There was still plenty to do and most of it fell to me. After all, this was a God damn ranch.",

Training him was more like bonding through mutual understanding. We navigated the field together, him learning the subtleties of my whistles and gestures, and me impressed by his quick learning and sharp instincts. Gradually, Tony became indispensable, demonstrating an uncanny understanding of the herd's movements. During the long, hot summers and biting winters, his presence was a constant that I could rely on. When work was especially tough, a pat on his head made things seem a bit easier. The years went by, but his spirit never dimmed. The day he passed, quietly under the old oak tree, there was a palpable emptiness throughout the ranch. Though the work continued, it felt heavier than it used to."

Pippa was bookish where Gillian was capable; she wore her hair pinned up, or in a long plait on one shoulder, which someone had once said—long ago, when it was still a rich chestnut brown—made her look like an Augustus John Gypsy. Still, you could see the two sisters’ close likeness: they were big and broad-shouldered like their father, with forthright, open pink faces, long, flat cheeks, an obstinate, set jaw. Both sisters had recently retired. Gillian had done something high up in management for the National Grid, and her husband had a business making thermostats for heating systems.

She pauses at the window, watching the world outside go about its day. A neighbor walks their dog, oblivious. Becky's gaze drifts to the potted plants on her windowsill, their leaves drooping slightly. She reaches for the watering can, nurturing them to distract herself. The simple act grounds her momentarily. She moves to her bookshelf, running her fingertips along the spines of well-loved novels, hoping to find comfort in a familiar story. As she settles into her favorite chair, book in hand, she notices her heartbeat has slowed. She exhales slowly. She may not be ready to eat yet, but she's found a small respite."

Two of the officers in the hallway, turning to see her, tipped their hats and put out their hands as if she had been summoned. “Sister,” one of them said. He was flushed and perspiring, and even in the dull light she could see that the cuffs of his jacket were singed. “Right in here.”",

Sister St. Savior approached with measured, purposeful steps, her habit rustling softly in the cool morning breeze. The officers, clustered by the skeletal frame of what was once a sturdy porch, straightened up at the sight of her, their soot-streaked faces showing signs of both relief and weariness. They stepped aside respectfully, nodding as she passed, silently acknowledging her authority. She moved among them with a calm resolve, taking in the scene and the survivors. Without pronouncement or flourish, she knelt by the remains, whispering prayers. She brought a calmness amidst the sorrow. The officers, emboldened by her steadiness, returned to their tasks, feeling a common bond: even in the aftermath of such loss, having tasks to focus on provided some solace."

No one would have described her as shy back then, and when she went to the beach with her cousin Molly the first afternoon and saw a group of boys sweating over a little black ball on the paddleball court she went right up to them, not five feet away, and watched as they leaped and grimaced and slammed at the ball with all the raw frustrated adolescent power boiling up out of them, until they began to falter, to hit out, to lose the rhythm of the game—and it was no secret why. It was because she was there, with her pretty, dark features, which everyone said were just like Rita Hayworth’s, with her nails freshly done and a white towel slung insouciantly over one shoulder, dressed in the swimsuit she’d spent the better part of an hour admiring in the full-length mirror at Genung’s before she said yes and counted out the money at the cash register. There were four boys playing and half a dozen others sprawled on the grass at the edge of the court, but the one who caught her eye—the tall one, with slicked-back dirty-blond hair, shrinking T-shirt, and black high-top basketball shoes that he wore without socks—was Sid.",

Here comes my little family! More and more people filled the yard. The girl began to laugh. This wasn’t a little family. It was a big family. Look—there’s Jan. He is the oldest and the wisest, with a wife and children. And there—there’s the sister who lives in London, who smiles like a movie star. And there’s the airline pilot. The girl knew that one of her brothers was an airline pilot who flew back and forth across the Atlantic every week. He was the tallest of them all—she knew it was him the minute she laid eyes on him—he turned around in the yard and when he caught sight of her he set down his suitcase and opened his arms, he was treetop tall and slim and the best-looking man she had ever seen, and she had, despite her tender years, seen lots, and she ran toward him and he swept her so high off the ground and swung her around so fast that she nearly lost her breath, but instead of losing her breath she opened her eyes, slowly, as if she were underwater, and from up there in his arms she saw not only Hammars, with its moors, its lambs, and its old limestone farmhouses, but the whole of Fårö, from the limestone quarry up at Norsholmen and the English cemetery south of Dämba to the sand dunes at Ullahau, where the girl had heard that you could go sledding in the winter, to the old grocery store down by the church and the beaches at Sudersand, Ekeviken, and Norsta Aurar, and all the way out to the sea stacks at Langhammars and Digerhuvud, and just when she thought he was going to set her down on the ground again his arms grew even longer and she rose even higher in the air and now she could see the ocean and the horizon and the Iron Curtain there in the distance, where, if you lose your way and end up there, they’ll never let you out.",

In our hushed goodnights, I sensed a longing for peace after the miles of road behind us. Come morning, the world outside our window was transformed by the first light, casting the modest cabins in a gentle glow. Over breakfast, I observed the other guests, each a mosaic of quiet conversations and shared gestures, their lives momentarily intersecting with ours. My daughter’s laughter blended into the ambient chatter, a sweet reminder of how resilient her spirit could be amid the newness of our surroundings. Reflecting on this, it struck me how brief encounters and small kindnesses at places like these could stitch together fragments of well-worn lives, offering moments of respite and fleeting connections in the tapestry of our journey.",

The breakfast room had mosaicked walls with glittering pink flamingoes and purple turtles. The guests were around our age, some of them newlyweds, others with kids just as young. Our daughters quickly found friends. All in all, the long journey and stress to get here had been worth it. The next week of our lives would be filled with beauty.",

        "Human-Written": "By the time we reach the tiny resort in the pitch-black night, I’m convinced that my life has capsized completely. I am worse than alone. I am a man travelling with bitter enemies who happen to be his most intimate family. It’s become Greek, or something worse. A roly-poly concierge emerges from an archway of bougainvillea, pushing a wheelbarrow and clenching a flashlight between his teeth. He’s very glad to see us, he says, once he has spit the flashlight out, his warm smile landing on our sorry faces. He informs us that the owners have gone to bed. They had stayed up waiting for us, but it got too late. He has the key, though, and will show us to our rooms. He stacks our luggage on the wheelbarrow, bites down on the flashlight again, and we all follow him down the twisting stone path. Wind generators on tall metal poles are humming and flapping like exotic birds. The constant wind off the Caribbean is tearing at the palms, forcing them into a savage dance. I have this strange wish, as we follow the bobbing beam of the flashlight, that we were all different people—strangers just happening to come together in the night. How much happier we might be if we didn’t know each other at all. No history. No remorse. Daybreak. The wind has calmed and the sea is flat and smooth clear to the horizon. The giant red sun presses up against the distant arc of the earth. How far away is the rest of the world? I’m the first one awake and happy to be alone on the beach. Tiny white crabs skitter into their holes at my approach. A string of sandpipers hurries ahead of me, darting in and out of the quiet surf. Above, the frigate bird soars. Turning back in the direction of the ancient Mayan ruins, I see the couple from St. Paul staring silently at the rising sun, the woman holding her vigil behind the wheelchair exactly as she did at the airport. The man, in dark glasses, sits erect with his hat in his lap, both hands holding the brim. As the monster sun mounts, the couple turns rosy red, then slowly bright orange, as though they might suddenly burst into flame, then crumble in ash to the sand. Neither of them moves an inch; they are frozen in the burning light. They have finally arrived. My daughter slips up beside me, still half asleep, in sweatpants and a T-shirt with Bob Marley’s face screaming across her chest.",

My daughter, clutching her stuffed rabbit, stayed close by my side, eyes wide, taking in the dimly lit lobby. In our quiet goodnights, I felt our longing for rest after miles of travel. Come morning, the world outside our window was transformed by the first light, casting the modest cabins in a gentle glow. Over breakfast, I observed the other guests, engaging in quiet conversations and familiar gestures, their lives momentarily intersecting with ours. My daughter’s laughter blended into the ambient chatter, a reminder of her resilience in our new surroundings. Reflecting on this, it became clear how small acts of kindness could offer brief moments of relief and connection in our journey."

Heloise, trying to fill the void, took on more responsibilities, caring for her brother and helping with household chores. But as she shouldered the burden, she felt invisible, her own emotions and needs ignored. Her mother's silence was deafening, and Heloise began to wonder if she was to blame for the accident, if she could have somehow prevented it.

Her brother's acting out escalated, and Heloise found herself caught in the middle, torn between her love for him and her resentment of his behavior.

Her mother devoted herself to work, demanding that her bosses assign her every work trip that came up.

She wept, organized her father's wardrobe, wrote to family and friends who had attended the funeral. The house, once filled with the noise of people full and alive, was now quiet. She took to playing classical music, Bach, Handel—her father's favorites. As the months dragged on, life turned easier to live, her grief not healed, but easier to live with. And then it happened: her mother getting up to leave for work on a Sunday morning and in the kitchen collapsing. Heloise had to lead her back to bed, where finally the woman started to weep. And her brother too, after his semester was over, with no more studying to do, forced to face what he'd been avoiding. Now, months after the accident, the three members of the family left could come together to properly grieve this loss they had suffered together.",

One of them was his lover, it turned out in the days and weeks after the crash, and the other one was his lover’s friend. He’d never even registered at the conference. Didn’t it seem strange, Heloise’s mother asked long afterward, in her creaky, surprised, lightly ironic voice, as if it only touched her curiosity, that the two lovebirds had taken a friend along with them for their tryst in Paris? The lover was also killed; her friend was seriously injured. Heloise’s mother, Angie, had found out some of these things when she rushed to be at her husband’s bedside in a hospital in France: he lived on for a few days after the accident, though he never recovered consciousness.",

As he entered adulthood, he struggled to form intimate relationships, fearing the vulnerability and potential loss that came with loving someone. His high-stress job as a financial analyst only exacerbated the issue, leading to chronic anxiety and sleepless nights. It wasn't until Yura's mother passed away, leaving him feeling lost and rudderless, that he began to confront the emotional baggage he'd been carrying.

They’d started after he published a controversial article in Izvestiya, which had been “rashly” approved by the department head while the editor-in-chief was on vacation. Yura was called to testify in front of the city’s Party committee. “You’ve crossed the line of what is permissible,” a man with the face of an old wolf had said to him. The department head was removed from his position with lightning speed. Yura’s career was hanging by a thread. He managed to hold onto it by a miracle; his father’s Party connections came in handy like never before. But his heart went out of whack, and the doctors said that he had suffered a small heart attack. He spent two months with Albina at a sanatorium. The second time his heart acted up was when his son was implicated in a disgusting story: a gang rape in a student dormitory. Yura’s father had recently died, and there was no one up there to appeal to for help. Yura had to go to a lot of offices, asking for favors and humiliating himself. His son was saved: he got away with probation. But after those six months Yura had to start taking heart medication. Then the problem had gone away.",

Growing up, he was the primary caregiver for his ailing mother, who suffered from a debilitating illness that left her bedridden for years. His childhood took a toll on Yura's well-being. As he entered adulthood, he struggled to form intimate relationships, fearing the vulnerability and potential loss that came with loving someone. His job as a financial analyst was high-stress. His mother's death marked the beginning of his journey toward healing. He started attending therapy sessions, where he slowly began to unpack the grief and guilt that had been simmering beneath the surface. Yura learned to recognize the physical symptoms of his anxiety and take proactive steps to manage them. He found solace in the quiet, methodical movements. As he slowly rebuilt his life, Yura began to form meaningful connections with others, including a kind-hearted coworker who would eventually become his partner. Yura's heart problems slowly improved as he learned to manage his anxiety and form meaningful connections with others."

She'd wake up before the sun rose, the silence of the morning a comforting blanket that wrapped around her. After a quick breakfast, she'd head to the grocery store, her list scribbled on a worn notebook page. As she wandered the aisles, her thoughts often drifted to her daughters, Emily and Rachel, and the countless times they'd accompanied her on these weekly trips. She'd recall Emily's giggles as they'd sample exotic fruits, and Rachel's serious scrutiny of the cereal options, the way they'd both sit in the cart, their little legs dangling, as she'd steer them through the crowded aisles. Now, as she navigated the crowded store alone, Evelyn's mind turned to the advice she'd impart to her girls when they'd call her later that day. She'd think about the importance of buying whole grains, of not sacrificing quality for convenience, and of the value of a well-stocked pantry. Her thoughts were a mix of practicality and nostalgia. As she selected a bunch of fresh parsley, Evelyn's mind wandered to Emily's latest cooking experiment, and she made a mental note to ask about it when they spoke. At the checkout line, she'd exchange pleasantries with the cashier, a woman around her age, with a kind face and a name tag that read \"Dolores,\" and wonder about her own story, her own daughters, and the countless meals she must have prepared for them over the years. The routine was comforting, but it was also a reminder that life was constantly in flux, and that the advice she gave her daughters was also a reminder to herself."

His strict discipline unsettlingly opposed my father's gentle nature, although he left when I was still young. My stepfather's demands influenced my routine like a drumbeat, persistent and rigorous. He taught me how to throw a punch, how to take a hit, and how to ensure I never had to back down. My father, on the other hand, had a soft-spoken, diminished presence that never leaked outside our rare visits. He showed me the beauty of words, the ways in which poetry instilled powerful empathy, and the necessity of forgiveness.

This dichotomy made me realize that true power lies not in the ability to inflict harm, but in the capacity to absorb and transform pain. As I grew older, I struggled to reconcile these conflicting figures of masculinity. However, this tension also forced me to develop my own, balanced perspective.

She always declared that she was starving and gave precise instructions as to what she wanted—Earl Grey tea and orange juice with triangles of buttered rye toast and honey—then ran out of appetite halfway through the first piece of toast. I sorted out her pills and watched to make sure she swallowed them, because she was full of private superstitions about her health; her doctors in their reports called her “this delightful elderly lady,” but she was skeptical of their strict instructions and carelessly forgot them. When I helped put in her hearing aids, she flinched and pulled her head away. “Ouch, Diane! Be careful, darling. Dickie was so gentle when he did them.” Her white hair was very fine and straight, and she wore it swept into a chignon, which I was allowed to pin, while she grimaced into the mirror as if I were skewering her. Then she put on her face, as she called it, sitting at her dressing table, attending with religious seriousness to making up that awful old woman in the reflection. Not that she was awful. Some beauties, it’s true, are simply extinguished as age descends, but the same old light was still shining in Margot, despite the drooping earlobes she loathed, the age spots, the tremulous pouting lower lip. These were part of her now, and the light shone through them. She’d kept the nervous fine line of her jaw, and the striking straight nose, and what the magazines call poise.

In her younger years, she had been enamored with the idea of being in love, often idealizing relationships and partners. She would get swept up in the thrill of new connections, convinced that each one was the start of something profound. But as the years went by and relationships came and went, she began to see the patterns of her own behavior - the way she would lose herself in someone else's gaze, the way she would compromise on her own desires to fit into someone else's narrative.

In her younger years, she had been enamored with the idea of being in love, often idealizing relationships and partners. With only the barest foundation she would let herself get swept away with each new love, its thrilling possibilities and projected future. But as the years went by and relationships came and went, she began to see the patterns of her own behavior - the way she would lose herself in someone else's gaze, the way she would compromise on her own desires to fit into someone else's narrative. She had to reckon with the extent to which her desire for love was a desire not to be alone, a desire to be validated and seen and desired, to be told: \"You are worthy.\" She needed these things from others because she didn't have them inside of herself.

At first, she's struck by the way the sunbeams seem to highlight their individual beauty, like a gentle spotlight on a stage. But as she lingers, she begins to observe the subtle ways they interact with the natural world around them. One woman, with a riot of curly hair, sits cross-legged on a blanket, her hands moving in slow motion as she braids a crown of wildflowers. Another, with skin the color of dark chocolate, stands tall, her eyes closed, her face tilted up to the sky as if drinking in the warmth. A third, with a scattering of freckles across her cheeks, lies on her back, her arms outstretched, her fingers curled around the edges of a worn paperback. What strikes Cecilia is the sense of quiet contentment that pervades the scene, as if these women have finally found a place where they can exhale, where the weight of the world has been temporarily lifted from their shoulders. She notices, too, the way they seem to be savoring the solitude, yet are not alone – they're accompanied by the rustling leaves, the chirping birds, and the soft, golden light that weaves them all together. It's as if they've discovered a hidden language, one that speaks directly to their souls, and Cecilia finds herself drawn to their peaceful, unhurried world.",

A third, with a scattering of freckles across her cheeks, was flat on her back, eyes shut, arms outstretched, as if flying inside a dream. A quiet contentment pervaded the scene, as if here was a place where they could leave the world behind and just be bodies. Here it was like transcending humanity, attaining divinity—Cecilia imagined it was the closest she'd gotten to God's Eden. It was like they'd discovered a lost secret, one that released their souls, and Cecilia found herself drawn entirely to it.",

At first, she's struck by the way the sunbeams seem to highlight their individual beauty, like a gentle spotlight on a stage. But as she lingers, she begins to observe the subtle ways they interact with the natural world around them. One woman, with a riot of curly hair, sits cross-legged on a blanket, her hands moving in slow motion as she braids a crown of wildflowers. Another, with skin the color of dark chocolate, stands tall, her eyes closed, her face tilted up to the sky as if drinking in the warmth. A third, with a scattering of freckles across her cheeks, lies on her back, her arms outstretched, her fingers curled around the edges of a worn paperback. What strikes Cecilia is the sense of quiet contentment that pervades the scene, as if these women have finally found a place where they can exhale, where the weight of the world has been temporarily lifted from their shoulders. She notices, too, the way they seem to be savoring the solitude, yet are not alone – they're accompanied by the rustling leaves, the chirping birds, and the soft, golden light that weaves them all together. It's as if they've discovered a hidden language, one that speaks directly to their souls, and Cecilia finds herself drawn to their peaceful, unhurried world."

His mother, Rina, was the first to react, her initial excitement about her son's impending marriage quickly giving way to anxiety and concern. She confided in her husband, Subhash, who was more measured in his response, but his silence spoke volumes. The tension simmered beneath the surface, as Pranab's parents struggled to come to terms with the idea of their son marrying outside their cultural and social circle. Rina couldn't help but wonder if her future daughter-in-law would adapt to their traditional ways, while Subhash fretted about the potential impact on their family's reputation. Pranab's siblings, too, were drawn into the fray, with his sister, Shreya, taking her mother's side and his brother, Rohan, defending Pranab's decision. As the days passed, the atmosphere at home grew increasingly strained, with conversations becoming stilted and awkward. Pranab, caught in the middle, felt his parents' disapproval like a weight, but he refused to back down, sensing that his happiness was at stake.

His mother, Rina, was the first to react, her initial excitement about her son's impending marriage falling out below her like a rotted oak floor. She confided in her husband, Subhash, never the type to start a fight and, now, a man who would not look his son in the eye. Even with the Brooklyn chill coming in through the windows, the air in the family's apartment simmered, as Pranab's parents struggled to come to terms with the idea of their son marrying outside their cultural and social circle. Rina couldn't help but wonder if her future daughter-in-law would adapt to their traditional ways, while Subhash asked each of Pranab's three sisters, his wife, and Kip, the jack russell, what the neighbors would think. Pranab's sister, Shreya, took her mother's side while their brother Rohan defended Pranab's decision. As the days passed, Pranab avoided the stilted \"hello\" and muttered \"where were you?\"s by spending more time with Jill. Though they were only around the corner, something about the sharp espresso, the table at the edge of the street--the same one he'd stubbed his toe on, spilling her morning coffee across her lap and starting all of this--felt very far away. His parents, meanwhile, were torn between their love for their son and their duty to uphold family traditions.

        "Human-Written": "Pranab Kaku’s parents were horrified by the thought of their only son marrying an American woman, and a few weeks later our telephone rang in the middle of the night: it was Mr. Chakraborty telling my father that they could not possibly bless such a marriage, that it was out of the question, that if Pranab Kaku dared to marry Deborah he would no longer acknowledge him as a son. Then his wife got on the phone, asking to speak to my mother, and attacked her as if they were intimate, blaming my mother for allowing the affair to develop. She said that they had already chosen a wife for him in Calcutta, that he’d left for America with the understanding that he’d go back after he had finished his studies, and marry this girl. They had bought the neighboring flat in their building for Pranab and his betrothed, and it was sitting empty, waiting for his return. “We thought we could trust you, and yet you have betrayed us so deeply,” his mother said, taking out her anger on a stranger in a way she could not with her son. “Is this what happens to people in America?” For Pranab Kaku’s sake, my mother defended the engagement, telling his mother that Deborah was a polite girl from a decent family. Pranab Kaku’s parents pleaded with mine to talk him out of the engagement, but my father refused, deciding that it was not their place to get embroiled in a situation that had nothing to do with them. “We are not his parents,” he told my mother. “We can tell him they don’t approve but nothing more.” And so my parents told Pranab Kaku nothing about how his parents had berated them, and blamed them, and threatened to disown Pranab Kaku, only that they had refused to give him their blessing. In the face of this refusal, Pranab Kaku shrugged. “I don’t care. Not everyone can be as open-minded as you,” he told my parents. “Your blessing is blessing enough.”",

He hates that his name is both absurd and obscure, that it has nothing to do with who he is, that it is neither Indian nor American but, of all things, Russian. He hates having to live with it, with a pet name turned good name, day after day, second after second. He hates seeing it on the brown-paper sleeve of the National Geographic subscription his parents got him for his birthday the year before, and seeing it perpetually listed in the high honor roll printed in the town’s newspaper. At times his name, an entity shapeless and weightless, manages nevertheless to distress him physically, like the scratchy tag of a shirt he has been forced permanently to wear. At times he wishes he could disguise it, shorten it somehow, the way the other Indian boy in his school, Jayadev, had got people to call him Jay. But Gogol, already short and catchy, resists mutation. Other boys his age have begun to court girls already, asking them to go to the movies or the pizza parlor, but he cannot imagine saying, “Hi, it’s Gogol” under potentially romantic circumstances.

My niece, like many children, had not been conditioned to tiptoe around insecurities or falsely appease others. This genuineness is what makes children's perspectives so valuable.

The first customers trickled in, their curiosity piqued by the buzz surrounding the restaurant's delayed opening. The kitchen sprang to life. Waiters hovered around tables, refilling water glasses with an air of nervousness. Chef Emma was struggling to keep up with the orders. Orders were called out, pots clanged, and the stoves roared to life, but Chef Emma was struggling to find her rhythm. Maria's business partner, Jack, stood by the till, watching the money roll in. The restaurant found its stride. The staff relaxed into their roles, the kitchen's tempo quickened, and the diners, initially hesitant, began to relax, their laughter and chatter mingling with the clinking of glasses.
