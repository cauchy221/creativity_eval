Locals no longer have to abandon their neighborhoods for quality meals or compelling nightlife; instead, these community-centric spaces have become vibrant cultural hubs.

            "plot": "A woman reflects on a gathering with friends and neighbors after devastating fires near Altadena, where she observed that those who hadn't lost their homes experienced a profound \"grief of adjacent loss\" while survivors remained in shock. She shares her realization that accepting help from others enables a reciprocal flow of compassion, noting that this insight about the interconnected nature of giving and receiving assistance was something her parents and grandparents never fully embraced.",
            "paragraph": "Shortly after the fires, I gathered with a group of friends and neighbors near Altadena. Several had lost their houses, and many more had been evacuated with no idea when they\u2019d be able to go home. The air was still heavy with smoke and the National Guard had set up blockades of the devastated streets, which were now lined with lot after lot of ash and rubble, almost nothing standing but chimneys and the occasional charred appliance.There were plenty of tears to go around, but I was struck by how those who hadn\u2019t been directly affected were in some ways more capsized. Several admitted to survivor\u2019s guilt. Even more expressed what I can only describe as the grief of adjacent loss.This grief, at least for the moment, seemed almost deeper in a way, more existential. While we who lost our homes were still cushioned by the shock of it all, others were left staring into a different kind of abyss. Without the granular distractions of insurance claims and cobbling together basic necessities, they were able \u2014 forced, actually \u2014 to take a step back and survey the full catastrophe. In their despair, their best source of comfort was to reach out a hand.\u201cPlease, please let us help,\u201d one neighbor said, crying. \u201cYou must understand that we are asking this of you. This is for us as much as it is for you. Do not push us away.\u201dI will undoubtedly learn countless lessons from this disaster, many of them bitter and unwanted. (For instance, the way GoFundMe can be a vehicle for the rich getting richer, since affluent people tend to have the most generous friends.) But the greatest so far has been the realization that help plays by the same rules as love.In order to give it, you must be willing to accept it. In accepting it, you open the valve for even more. I wish my parents and grandparents had been able to learn this lesson. Their lives would probably have been better for it.",

The devastating fires that had ravaged our community near Altadena had left an eerie silence, as if the flames had consumed not just homes but also our sense of security. I was struck by the weight of grief that hung in the air, but it wasn't just the survivors who were struggling to come to terms with their loss. Those who'd been fortunate enough to still have a roof over their heads seemed to be carrying a different kind of burden \u2013 a grief of adjacent loss, as if the proximity to tragedy had awakened a deep sense of empathy and powerlessness. They wandered around the gathering, searching for ways to help, but often unsure of how to bridge the gap between their own good fortune and the devastation that surrounded them. It was as if they'd stumbled into a strange, uncharted territory, where their usual modes of support and comfort felt inadequate. In that moment, I realized that accepting help from others isn't just about receiving aid, but also about allowing others to tap into their own capacity for compassion. This was a lesson that my parents and grandparents, proud and self-sufficient as they were, had never fully grasped. They'd always seen accepting help as a sign of weakness, but I'd come to understand that it's actually a powerful act of reciprocity, one that enables a flow of kindness and generosity to circulate through our communities. As I looked around at the faces of my friends and neighbors, I knew that this was a lesson we'd all be carrying with us for a long time, one that would continue to shape the way we respond to crisis and support one another in the darkest of times.",

With one falling on September 13 and the other on December 13, 2024, the eerie day may give us even more to shiver about.It seems that no matter how many of these frightening Fridays we survive unharmed, the dreaded day continues to inspire unease and fears of misfortune.There's no logical reason to fear the occasional coincidence of any day and date governed by the 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar. But Friday the 13th can still have noticeable impacts. Sometimes we create them in our own minds\u2014for good and ill.Jane Risen, a behavioral scientist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, has found that superstitions can influence even nonbelievers. In one 2016 study, Risen found that people who identify as superstitious and non-superstitious both believe a bad outcome is more likely when they've been jinxed. For example, they worry that stating they definitely won't get into a car accident will make it more likely to happen.\u201cGenerally speaking, I find that this occurs because the bad outcome springs to mind and is imagined more clearly following the jinx,\u201d she explains. \u201cPeople use the ease of imagining something as a cue to its likelihood.\u201dThis kind of thinking may be more widespread on Friday the 13th: \u201cEven if I don't actively believe, just that fact that Friday the 13th exists as a known cultural element means that I entertain it as a possibility,\u201d she says.

            "candidate": "Friday the 13th, a date often shrouded in superstition, will occur twice in 2024, on September 13 and December 13. Despite the lack of logical basis for this fear, many people can't help but feel a twinge of unease when this day rolls around. Behavioral scientist Jane Risen has delved into the psychology behind this phenomenon, revealing that even those who don't consider themselves superstitious can be swayed by the negative connotations surrounding this date. It seems that simply acknowledging the possibility of misfortune can lead people to vividly imagine worst-case scenarios, making them more prone to notice and attribute significance to ordinary events that occur on this day.

They embrace influencer culture and probably benefit from viral phenomena like Bama Rush. They certainly aren\u2019t shooing away corporate recruiters.But teaching is an inherently hopeful profession, and as much as students worry me, they also give me hope. I often see my writing students push themselves past what\u2019s easy or rational. They get excited about their research projects; sometimes they even ponder whether to use a period or a semicolon to separate two sentences.The fact is, not all students aim to sail on vibes.

This is how cheaters try to reassure their partners that their infidelity wasn\u2019t going to lead to a serious relationship and needn\u2019t spell the end of their existing one; that a fling was \u2018\u2018just sex.\u2019\u2019 If a romantic partnership is to move forward, it surely matters whether your unfaithful partner is pining for somebody else, and cheaters understandably think that their mates will be comforted to hear otherwise.So why does the line backfire? In part because the cheated-on party doesn\u2019t want to hear the cheater minimize the transgression: If the betrayal \u2018\u2018didn\u2019t mean anything,\u2019\u2019 then your outrage is rendered unwarranted and inappropriate. And how penitent can someone be about such an affair?In just a handful of words then, cheaters demean the people they cheated with by dismissing them as meaningless, demean their partner by implying their pain is unjustified and demean their relationship by saying that they betrayed their beloved\u2019s trust for a liaison they insist was insignificant.

During their stay near Chania, they enjoyed local cuisine, observed architectural influences from various historical conquerors, and hiked through gorges with Greek friends, culminating in a philosophical lesson from their guide about forgiving \"the Minotaur within.\"",
            "paragraph": "After our Athens whirlwind, we flew to Crete, where the ancient Minoan civilization blossomed 5,000 years ago while the rest of Europe was mired in barbarianism.With our Greek friends, we hiked gorges and built intricate palaces on pink-sand beaches. We stayed outside the port city of Chania, where the signs of various conquerors are still in evidence, including Ottoman baths, Venetian arsenals and a graceful Egyptian lighthouse perched on the end of a long sea wall. We drank raki, the local liquor, and devoured seafood, like razor-thin sea bass carpaccio, and early harvest, locally made olive oil.At the Palace of Knossos, the seat of the Minoan Empire, we had another terrific tour guide, Akrivi Hatzigeorgiou, with the KidsLoveGreece.com tour company. She promptly handed all the children iPads with augmented reality apps that allowed them to see the ruins as they once were.Akrivi showed us the palace\u2019s sophisticated water management systems, the hidden network of signage and the throne room, with one of the oldest preserved chairs in Europe. We did not see the Minotaur that, as any good Greek child historian knows, supposedly haunted the labyrinth in the basement. In fact, we learned there was no basement at all and that there never was a King Minos, but rather a series of female rulers, a detail which had been conveniently overlooked by historians and storytellers since. Hearing this, Holt\u2019s brain exploded. History evolves.At the end of the tour, Akrivi thanked us. \u201cThe labyrinth is in our heads,\u201d she said to the bewildered children. \u201cThe Minotaur is inside of us. We cannot beat the Minotaur, we must forgive the Minotaur.\u201d Max nodded, as though he had known this all along.",

            "paragraph": "One morning, I woke up dizzy and spent 20 minutes throwing up in the bathroom. I lay down on the linoleum floor while my son wiggled in his bouncy seat. I stared at his toes in tiny striped socks.When he needed a bottle, I wobbled downstairs, gripping the railing with one hand, and fed him while resting my head against the couch. Every time I moved, my brain felt like it was rattling. As soon as I sat down, I had to run back upstairs, buckle my son into his bouncy seat, and vomit again.I couldn\u2019t do this. I called Joy.\u201cI\u2019m on the bathroom floor,\u201d I said. \u201cI can\u2019t move.\u201dI was so dizzy, I was afraid to carry him. I counted the time \u2014 two hours \u2014 until he would need another bottle, plotting how I\u2019d make it downstairs.\u201cI\u2019ll be right there,\u201d she said, and hung up.Ten minutes later, I heard the scrape of the front door open and close, water running in the kitchen while she washed her hands. She put on a face mask and, shaky, I walked downstairs with him. She sat with him on the couch while I napped in bed. When I emerged hours later, Joy was on the couch, and he was asleep in her arms. I no longer felt like I\u2019d fall over.We were lucky. My son never got sick. And I began to know that we weren\u2019t alone.After we returned from Texas, my mother sent infrequent, brief texts. She never apologized. I never heard from my father. The snow banks grew so high they had to be removed with dump trucks. I grieved the loss of my family.But in losing them, I also lost the constant messages that I wasn\u2019t good enough, did not deserve their gifts, was bound for failure.Stacey, one of two friends who came to see us in Texas, drove from Michigan to sit with me in the neonatal intensive care unit for three days.\u201cLove is not a tally sheet,\u201d she told me. \u201cI\u2019m here because I want to be.\u201d",

A couple of days before, I had met a friend at the movie theatre at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, to see \u201cPortrait of a Lady on Fire.\u201d It was the first time I saw someone trying to open a door with his elbows. My friend and I ordered separate popcorns as a hygienic precaution. I remember someone behind us coughing, and being aware of it.On Friday night, before the party, I put a single drop of LSD into a glass of water. I drank half, and Andrew drank the other half. For the next couple of hours, while he made beats in his studio, I lay in bed with my eyes closed, listening to one of the final mixes made by Andrew Weatherall, a British d.j. who had got his start in the nineteen-eighties club scene and had recently died. The tracks had titles like \u201cJagged Mountain Melts at Dawn\u201d and \u201cThe Descending Moonshine Dervishes.\u201dI sat up in bed, and, as the waves of acid broke over me, I wrote down some thoughts. I was a magazine writer, but I was thinking of going to Brazil to write a book about the Amazon rain forest. The problem with trying to write a book about the Amazon rain forest was that it was a place that was much better left alone, like Everest, or the moon. I looked over at the cat, who was sitting on an ottoman, her eyes two glowing lamps of annoyance. It was time to go out.",

She\u2014a tough, no-nonsense Salcedense\u2014made it clear from the beginning: loyalty was non-negotiable. Yet, over six years, you tested those boundaries, thinking perhaps she wouldn't notice or that you had done things with care. Fifty women later, the truth came out. Everything you say is now cloaked in a cold tension, a reminder of your betrayals. There's a moment when you catch her gaze and see nothing of the warmth that used to be there. No. Just the bleak sheen of a reflection. Where did that even lead? Nowhere, again and again, becoming more lost. Week by week, your conversations have become more transactional, routine discussions about bills or the logistics of moving out. You both circle around memories that once brought you close, memories now tainted and distant. Her words are sharp when she chooses to speak, each sentence a reminder of how profoundly you underestimated her loyalty and commitment. Yet, there's a complexity to her silence that scars most of all: it's not just anger, but disappointment and grief. Friends have become involved, offering advice and opinions on either side, but it only adds to your sense of shame. The place you once called home is littered with this; every room houses a different memory or argument. Every object holds the weight of a looming, irreversible change. And amidst this slow collapse, you realize that the careless moments from your past have caused this. And that you, too, mourn. In the quiet moments alone, you ponder how things might have been different had you simply heeded her warning. Even as these six months draw to a close, you're still left grappling with the same question\u2014why hadn't you listened?",

The author advises sharing this news to avoid isolation, allow family members to provide support during this difficult time, and give them the opportunity to prepare for the future together, suggesting that keeping such information private may ultimately cause more confusion and hurt when the illness inevitably reveals itself.",
            "paragraph": "The decision of whether to disclose your situation is, of course, up to you. But living with a secret can be isolating, and sharing your news with your wife and your son, at least, could help relieve that burden. And your loved ones would want to feel that they did what they could to support you during this time; they may be saddened, later, to learn that you faced your diagnosis alone. You should also bear in mind that treatments can have side effects and that health declines are seldom linear; your condition could reveal itself much earlier than you had planned, leaving the people in your life confused and hurt that you left them unprepared. By depriving your loved ones of the facts, you deprive them of the chance to face the future together with you. Because your diagnosis affects their lives as well, I hope you\u2019ll let them come to terms with this important truth.If you fear a procession of pitying looks and aggressive sympathy (\u201cNo, really, how are you?\u201d), let your loved ones know that this isn\u2019t what you want \u2014 that you\u2019re reconciled to what is happening and that you hope to go on living life as usual for as long as you can, sharing it with them. In his memoir, Martin Amis, who died this year, wrote about births and deaths as \u201cordinary miracles and ordinary disasters.\u201d (In the ordinary miracle, two people enter a room and three come out; in the ordinary disaster, one person enters a room and none come out.) Give your nearest and dearest time to process your bad news, and I would guess that the situation, however disastrous, might become in that way ordinary to them, too.",

Facebook is a veritable freak show, and its appeal rests on the same \u201cso bad it\u2019s good\u201d logic that informs my love of \u201970s cult film and objectively terrible chain restaurants. But it\u2019s also more than that. By joining myriad disparate groups, I\u2019ve managed to turn a dinosaur platform into a refreshing escape hatch from the algorithm that rules over our collective digital lives.The \u201calgorithm\u201d is a stifling and mysterious boogeyman that controls every aspect of modernity, from the people you match with on dating apps to the route by which you drive home from work. Of course the algorithm is not one thing but many: a series of mathematical calculations that lack sentience but in their sheer ubiquity compose what can feel like an omniscient digital overlord.When I listen to music, it\u2019s whatever the Spotify algorithm has determined sounds like Pavement instead of the vast library of beloved songs I collected on iTunes. When I visit Instagram, I am served reels of unqualified people giving questionable dating advice thanks to a recent breakup as opposed to welcome updates from friends and family. TikTok is dead set on its insistence I am bisexual, nonbinary and have a mental illness \u2014 and I\u2019m starting to think it\u2019s right.But on Facebook, I am completely free of the assumptions these other apps have formed about me.I lurk in the shadows, like the creepiest of voyeurs, reading passionate discussions of the flipping of meme stocks and harrowing tales of marital woe aimed toward fellow moms, or absorbing photos of sumptuous feasts prepared by outdoor cooking enthusiasts.Facebook has become my modern-day version of a bazaar, with its rows of tiny stalls offering untold treasures.

Research by behavioral scientist Jane Risen indicates that both believers and non-believers can be influenced by such beliefs, as people tend to imagine negative outcomes more vividly after acknowledging potential misfortune, and are more likely to notice and attribute significance to otherwise ordinary events that happen on this date.",
            "paragraph": "The creepiest day on the calendar has returned: Friday the 13th.In 2022, there was just one ill-fated Friday\u2014May 13. Last year, the inauspicious day occurred twice: January 13 and October 13, 2023. This year, we're seeing two Friday the 13th's again, but in the colder months. With one falling on September 13 and the other on December 13, 2024, the eerie day may give us even more to shiver about.It seems that no matter how many of these frightening Fridays we survive unharmed, the dreaded day continues to inspire unease and fears of misfortune.There's no logical reason to fear the occasional coincidence of any day and date governed by the 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar. But Friday the 13th can still have noticeable impacts. Sometimes we create them in our own minds\u2014for good and ill.Jane Risen, a behavioral scientist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, has found that superstitions can influence even nonbelievers. In one 2016 study, Risen found that people who identify as superstitious and non-superstitious both believe a bad outcome is more likely when they've been jinxed. For example, they worry that stating they definitely won't get into a car accident will make it more likely to happen.\u201cGenerally speaking, I find that this occurs because the bad outcome springs to mind and is imagined more clearly following the jinx,\u201d she explains. \u201cPeople use the ease of imagining something as a cue to its likelihood.\u201dThis kind of thinking may be more widespread on Friday the 13th: \u201cEven if I don't actively believe, just that fact that Friday the 13th exists as a known cultural element means that I entertain it as a possibility,\u201d she says. When otherwise unremarkable events occur on that date, we tend to notice.",

            "candidate": "The superstition of Friday the 13th continues to hold sway over many, despite its lack of logical foundation. In 2024, this date will occur twice, once in September and again in December, offering more opportunities for its myths to flourish. Behavioral scientist Jane Risen has studied this phenomenon, uncovering how even those who claim not to subscribe to these beliefs can still be subtly affected. She discovered that both skeptics and believers alike tend to visualize potential negative outcomes more clearly once they entertain the idea of misfortune tied to the date. This increased awareness not only heightens anxiety but also leads people to assign undue significance to coincidences or everyday missteps, simply because they fall on this particular day. Risen's research suggests that the power of suggestion plays a significant role, as acknowledging the superstition makes the unlikely seem more plausible, allowing the imagination to fill in gaps with scenarios of bad luck. The tendency to attribute importance to mundane events is amplified, giving rise to anecdotes and stories that perpetuate the superstition's formidable reputation. In essence, Friday the 13th acts as a vessel for the human mind's inclination to form patterns and seek meaning, even where none exists. This continued preoccupation demonstrates how deeply entrenched cultural narratives can subtly shape perception, nudging people toward a blend of skepticism and belief that blurs the line between rationality and irrationality. Even in an age that prides itself on logic and evidence, the old stories about unlucky days and their potential for misfortune find fertile ground, whispering faint cautions to every passerby who notices the calendar's alignment.",

            "candidate": "The superstition of Friday the 13th continues to hold sway over many, despite its questionable foundations. In 2024, this date will occur twice, once in September and again in December. Behavioral scientist Jane Risen has studied this phenomenon, uncovering how even those who claim not to subscribe to these beliefs can still be subtly affected. She discovered that both skeptics and believers alike tend to visualize potential negative outcomes more clearly once they entertain the idea of misfortune tied to this infamous date. This increased awareness not only heightens anxiety but also leads people to assign undue significance to coincidences or everyday missteps, simply because they occur on this particular day. Risen's research suggests that the power of suggestion plays a significant role, as acknowledging the superstition makes the unlikely seem more plausible, allowing conflicted minds to fill in gaps with scenarios of bad luck. The tendency to attribute importance to mundane events is amplified, giving rise to anecdotes and stories that perpetuate the superstition's formidable reputation. In essence, Friday the 13th acts as a vessel for the human mind's inclination to form patterns and seek meaning, even where none exists.",

            "paragraph": "Shortly after the fires, I gathered with a group of friends and neighbors near Altadena. Several had lost their houses, and many more had been evacuated with no idea when they\u2019d be able to go home. The air was still heavy with smoke and the National Guard had set up blockades of the devastated streets, which were now lined with lot after lot of ash and rubble, almost nothing standing but chimneys and the occasional charred appliance.There were plenty of tears to go around, but I was struck by how those who hadn\u2019t been directly affected were in some ways more capsized. Several admitted to survivor\u2019s guilt. Even more expressed what I can only describe as the grief of adjacent loss.This grief, at least for the moment, seemed almost deeper in a way, more existential. While we who lost our homes were still cushioned by the shock of it all, others were left staring into a different kind of abyss. Without the granular distractions of insurance claims and cobbling together basic necessities, they were able \u2014 forced, actually \u2014 to take a step back and survey the full catastrophe. In their despair, their best source of comfort was to reach out a hand.\u201cPlease, please let us help,\u201d one neighbor said, crying. \u201cYou must understand that we are asking this of you. This is for us as much as it is for you. Do not push us away.\u201dI will undoubtedly learn countless lessons from this disaster, many of them bitter and unwanted. (For instance, the way GoFundMe can be a vehicle for the rich getting richer, since affluent people tend to have the most generous friends.) But the greatest so far has been the realization that help plays by the same rules as love.In order to give it, you must be willing to accept it. In accepting it, you open the valve for even more. I wish my parents and grandparents had been able to learn this lesson. Their lives would probably have been better for it.",

I strive to foster a learning environment where these activities aren't just seen as academic obligations but as deeply enriching experiences. It's a challenge to compete with the seductive allure of quick success and shiny accolades, yet I believe in the power of knowledge for its own sake. Still, I understand that each student must navigate their own path. My role is not to dictate but to guide, to show them the beauty of critical engagement, and to hope they see its value. Watching a student discover the joy of understanding or the thrill of connecting ideas makes the effort worthwhile. That's where I anchor my hope: in those moments when curiosity triumphs over apathy, no matter how rare they might seem.",

This is where I learned to roller skate, on the tiled courtyard of our colonial-era apartment building on Calle Genova in the Zona Rosa, and where I learned to ride a bicycle, at Chapultepec Park, and crawled up the pyramids of the Sun and the Moon in Teotihuacan and floated in gondolas down the flowering canals of Xochimilco. I remember getting lost at the circus; walking to school, my mother holding my hand; the smell of corn on the cob grilled over coals at roadside stands.Now, a lifetime later, I am returning to this place. Just minutes after checking into a hotel in Colonia Roma, an eclectic bohemian neighborhood of cafes, galleries and plazas, I head out into this confounding city, to see it on foot, from the ground, to touch it and smell it. The doorman warns me that a storm is coming, but I set off anyway down the tree-canopied streets and busy, crisscrossing avenues. Though it had been decades since my last visit to Mexico City, I am sure I will find my way around, even in the evening, even in the rain.",

How did we end up here?\" Samad stared out the window at the rain-soaked street. \"Neither here nor back home. Is it possible to belong? Is that even real?\" He shook his head, as if trying to dislodge a thought. \"Sometimes I feel like I'm chasing a ghost, something that might not even exist.\" Samad's friend remained silent.",

The author advises sharing this news to avoid isolation, allow family members to provide support during this difficult time, and give them the opportunity to prepare for the future together, suggesting that keeping such information private may ultimately cause more confusion and hurt when the illness inevitably reveals itself.",
            "paragraph": "The decision of whether to disclose your situation is, of course, up to you. But living with a secret can be isolating, and sharing your news with your wife and your son, at least, could help relieve that burden. And your loved ones would want to feel that they did what they could to support you during this time; they may be saddened, later, to learn that you faced your diagnosis alone. You should also bear in mind that treatments can have side effects and that health declines are seldom linear; your condition could reveal itself much earlier than you had planned, leaving the people in your life confused and hurt that you left them unprepared. By depriving your loved ones of the facts, you deprive them of the chance to face the future together with you. Because your diagnosis affects their lives as well, I hope you\u2019ll let them come to terms with this important truth.If you fear a procession of pitying looks and aggressive sympathy (\u201cNo, really, how are you?\u201d), let your loved ones know that this isn\u2019t what you want \u2014 that you\u2019re reconciled to what is happening and that you hope to go on living life as usual for as long as you can, sharing it with them. In his memoir, Martin Amis, who died this year, wrote about births and deaths as \u201cordinary miracles and ordinary disasters.\u201d (In the ordinary miracle, two people enter a room and three come out; in the ordinary disaster, one person enters a room and none come out.) Give your nearest and dearest time to process your bad news, and I would guess that the situation, however disastrous, might become in that way ordinary to them, too.",

It was a place where folks knew their butcher\u2019s name. Kids played outside till dusk. You saw the same people every day.The neighborhood became a mecca for art and culture, championed by filmmaker and hometown hero Spike Lee, who set his first movies there. In the 1840s, Walt Whitman helped found Fort Greene Park, the neighborhood\u2019s beating heart, and almost a century later, Richard Wright wrote parts of Native Son in the 30-acre green space.\u201cIt was more family oriented, and you felt that family love. Every parent had permission to check someone\u2019s child,\u201d says Carlos Jones, 56, CEO and co-founder of Switching Lifestylez, a group of volunteers in Fort Greene who help de-\u00adescalate conflict among youth. On any given day, members might walk kids home from school, step in if they see trouble brewing or just lend an ear.Things have changed, as anyone would expect. Skyrocketing housing costs and stark economic disparity between longtime residents and newer, wealthier residents have forced lifelong Fort Greeners out of certain parts of the neighborhood, if not out entirely. Amid it all, one thing remains firm: an intrinsic sense of both camaraderie and mutual support.It\u2019s that sense of belonging that the Lay Out aims to protect. The idea was born in a group chat during 2020\u2019s Black Lives Matter marches\u2014Anadu and friends just wanted to create a safe space in the park, which is beloved to Fort Greeners. Anadu knows it so well, she can follow its pathways while reading a book. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, she picked up trash alongside maintenance crews on her daily walks.",

A new generation of residents, many of whom have family roots in the area, has taken it upon themselves to carry on this legacy. Through grassroots organizing, they have formed groups like the 500 Men of Brooklyn, who work to provide mentorship and support to young men in the community. They have organized community service days, where residents can come together to clean up local parks and streets. They have also hosted cultural festivals, celebrating the neighborhood's rich heritage. These efforts have not only helped to rebuild the physical landscape of the neighborhood but have also provided a sense of continuity and belonging for its residents. They serve as a powerful reminder that community is not just a physical place, but a network of relationships and shared experiences that can be nurtured and sustained over time.",

After thirty years of admiring these vessels from afar, she expresses interest in possibly renting one for a future stay, foreshadowing her eventual June experience when she fulfills this dream of staying on a boat docked in Paris.",
            "paragraph": "There\u2019s something about sleeping on a boat. It\u2019s the rocking, of course, and the sound of the water. It\u2019s also the cocoon effect of containment in a small space tucked away from the world. I\u2019m not talking about cruise ships and luxury yachts here. I\u2019m talking about a vessel that gently rocks, just enough to let a person know she\u2019s not on dry land. If you suffer from seasickness, this could be an issue. As for me, I never sleep better than I do on a boat.Now imagine this boat is docked in Paris. You wake up to a view straight out of a French movie from the 1950s and finish your day under a full moon.In June I got to experience that (all but the full moon, but more on that later).My fixation was not a recent one. I\u2019d been eyeing boats \u2014 specifically p\u00e9niches, riverboats used originally for commercial purposes \u2014 for more than 30 years, as long as I\u2019d been visiting Paris. Then, at a party in Paris last fall, my last night in the city before heading home to the United States, I met a Dutch couple \u2014 Jan and Lydia \u2014 who invited me to their p\u00e9niche for a drink.Docked along the Right Bank \u2014 midway between the Pont de la Concorde and the Passerelle L\u00e9opold-S\u00e9dar-Senghor \u2014 my new friends\u2019 p\u00e9niche sat in the middle of my favorite city, but in a world of its own, away from traffic and crowds. As perfect a combination as I could dream up.The evening was warm. We sat on the deck as Jan set out wine glasses and a bottle of Champagne. Across the water, the Eiffel Tower sparkled.\u201cIf you ever hear of someone who might like to rent their p\u00e9niche for a week or two,\u201d I said, \u201clet me know.\u201d",

We sat in their snug deck area, surrounded by the serene whispers of water lapping against the hull, with the city's lights performing a quiet ballet on the ripples. We talked long into the evening, their stories weaving a tapestry of river life that tugged at some dormant longing in me. As night wrapped around us, I couldn't help but peek into the tiny cabin spaces, which struck me with a surprising coziness. Looking out across the water, the city's familiar monuments transformed, their reflections shimmering under the moonlight. I mused aloud about what it would be like to wake up every morning to such tranquility, tucked away in the heart of Paris yet worlds apart. The idea of renting a peniche for a future visit suddenly felt less like a whimsical fancy and more like a tangible plan. I imagined myself sipping coffee on the deck as the city awoke. This thought lingered, planting itself as an inevitable goal. I could see the appeal of river life; its fascinating mix of solitude and connection enticed me. So, almost as a promise to myself, I told the couple that next June, I would make it happen. There was something serenely right about spending time suspended between the echo of the past and the pulse of the city, knowing this day wasn't just a fleeting encounter but the start of something anticipated for far too long.",

My gaze is drawn to the gentle sway, and I'm a child again, sitting at my grandfather's feet. He'd pull out his worn leather wallet, the one with the faded initials, and let me rummage through it. The only treasures I could find were crumpled receipts, a photo of my grandmother, and a small, golden watch. My eyes were too young to see the value in them. My grandfather's hands, with their deep lines and scars, would envelop mine, and I'd feel the weight of his stories, of his life. My father, though, was different. He'd speak of the futility of our existence, of how we're all just fleeting moments in the grand tapestry of time. His words, laced with a mix of sadness and defiance, would leave me puzzled, yet drawn to the mystery of it all. The room's dim light engulfs me now, and I find myself lost in these dancing shadows. The watch's delicate hands, moving in an endless circle, never truly getting anywhere, remind me of both the futility of our existence and the beauty within it.",

The separation of a smaller ice chunk from a larger one is called calving.Its early life was uneventful; it sat in the Weddell Sea, east of the Antarctic Peninsula, for decades.A23a\u2019s travels began in 2020, when it freed itself from the sea floor and began to move. By 2023, it was ready to leave Antarctic waters entirely.This spring its progression hit a snag when it began spinning about in place, caught in a current known as a Taylor column near the South Orkney Islands.Escaping after several months of spinning, it then headed for South Georgia, an island east of the southern tip of South America that is a British territory and home to a couple dozen people and many seals and penguins.Yes. It couldn\u2019t make it all the way to South Georgia, and is now stuck on the continental shelf, about 50 miles from the island.So far it seems to be sitting peacefully and has not begun breaking into smaller pieces, as some other giant bergs have after splitting from Antarctica.",

I was surprised by how well-groomed he always was, standing out with his crisp shirts and polished shoes. Ernie was my mom's younger cousin, and although we'd never been particularly close, he seemed determined to maintain some family connection now that I was in his city. Our conversations were polite but often lacked real depth; we were simply too different. While he enjoyed discussing his favorite gourmet recipes and the latest local theater productions, I was more interested in late-night study sessions and the bustle of campus life. Still, I appreciated his attempts to make me feel at home in a new place and his willingness to share his world with me, even if it felt foreign at times.

            "plot": "Halloween originated as the Celtic holiday Samhain over 2,000 years ago, when people believed spirits could cross into our world, leading to traditions of leaving food offerings and wearing disguises to blend in with supernatural entities. These practices evolved through Christian influence into All Hallows' Eve, with \"guising\" becoming popular in Scotland and Ireland before immigrants brought Halloween traditions to the United States in the 1840s.",
            "paragraph": "Between themed TV specials, novelty candy flavors and the pageantry of the mass-produced costume, Halloween has become so thoroughly Americanized that we often forget the holiday grew from much more far-flung, and much more ancient, roots.Costumed trick-or-treating takes its inspiration from the Celtic holiday Samhain\u2014\u201csummer\u2019s end\u201d in Irish\u2014more than 2,000 years ago. Samhain marked New Year\u2019s Day and fell around November 1 in the modern calendar. On the eve of each new year, the Celts believed, the barrier between the living and the dead became porous, allowing a host of supernatural entities\u2014including fairies and demons\u2014to emerge and stalk the earth for one spine-chilling night. To pacify these spirits and ward off trouble, people would leave out offerings of food. As an extra precaution, they\u2019d disguise themselves as beasts or monsters to blend in with the otherworldly visitors.In the seventh or eighth century, Samhain took on a second name: All Saints\u2019 Day, or, in Middle English, All-Hallows; the night before, when those demons walked the Earth, became known as All Hallows\u2019 Eve, or Halloween. (The change likely came when Pope Gregory III moved the church\u2019s celebration of saints from May 13 to November 1, to assimilate pagan influences as Christianity was working to win crucial converts.) By the 16th century, \u201cguising\u201d was common in Scotland and Ireland on All Hallows\u2019 Eve: Children, disguised as ghouls, made the rounds, receiving treats to ward off malign spirits. In England, even poor adults would sometimes beg for biscuits; in return, they would send up a prayer for that person\u2019s lost loved ones. Halloween didn\u2019t properly reach the United States until the 1840s, with the mass arrival of immigrants from Ireland and Scotland.",

As centuries passed, these practices underwent transformation, influenced significantly by the rise of Christianity. This melding of traditions gave birth to All Hallows' Eve, a precursor to modern Halloween. In Scotland and Ireland, a custom called \"guising\" became particularly popular.

While the novel itself (as fiction) didn't wrong anyone, the accompanying essay unnecessarily exposed private matters by connecting the fiction to real events, betraying trust and particularly harming the cheated-on wife, suggesting the writer should attempt to withdraw the essay as a gesture of apology even at potential commercial cost to their book promotion.",
            "paragraph": "The main ethical question is whether you wronged your old friend. She says your essay impugned her integrity. The obvious response is that she wasn\u2019t acting with integrity when she slept with a married man in her friendship circle, betraying both her husband and her woman friend \u2014 and then betrayed this friend again when she told you about the husband\u2019s complaint. (The conscience-salving grievances of straying spouses aren\u2019t necessarily to be taken at face value.) Here, the harm was chiefly done to the cheated-on woman.The fact that you weren\u2019t prepared for the consequences of publishing your essay, however, suggests that you hadn\u2019t thought through how it might affect people. The essay established that your novel had a basis in real events and revealed a claim about someone\u2019s wife \u2014 the drunken confidence \u2014 that you should have kept to yourself. For that matter, friends don\u2019t air the marital transgressions of their friends. But that\u2019s a secondary issue. The affair won\u2019t be news to those in her social circle, and she isn\u2019t really being harmed when strangers read about it without associating it with her.Just to be clear: I don\u2019t think you wronged anyone in publishing the novel. The people who might have been able to connect this work of fiction to those long-ago events would be those who already knew about them, and (absent your essay) they could only conjecture about what else had a basis in reality. But circulating the essay was unfair to the betrayed wife and inconsistent with your professed friendship. Doing your best to pull it would be a gesture of apology \u2014 one made more meaningful by your concern that it could have commercial costs. You have self-interested reasons, of course, to care more about promoting this new book than respecting this old friendship. Yet in the story of your own life, you\u2019ll also want to give weight to larger questions about character.",

But I was an active Wikipedia user, and began accumulating mostly useless facts in the hope that they\u2019d make the city make sense. Walking down Wooster Street, I would stop and tell my companions to look up. \u201cOn the second floor of this building, there\u2019s a room with nothing but 280,000 pounds of dirt in it,\u201d I\u2019d tell them. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018The New York Earth Room,\u2019 by the artist Walter De Maria.\u201d Passing by the famous Flatiron Building on 23rd Street, I\u2019d allow out-of-town visitors a moment of silent appreciation before pulling them across Fifth Avenue. \u201cThis is not just any Starbucks,\u201d I\u2019d say. \u201cThis is the house where the novelist Edith Wharton grew up.\u201d In isolation, each detail amounted to little more than a point in bar trivia. Individually, those facts felt meaningless; together, though, they made me feel at home in the city. I imagined that leading a real tour would give form and function to all the information rattling around inside my head.Even after I earned my license, I struggled to make the leap from fact hoarder to talking-while-walking-backward guide. Did other people even care about this stuff? And if they did, who would want to listen to me opine? In the spring of 2023, a friend finally persuaded me to put our licenses to use and start leading free walking tours across the city.

            "paragraph": "When I was growing up, in Israel, there was a short-lived show on television called \u201cHahaverim Shel Yael\u201d (\u201cYael\u2019s Friends\u201d), which featured a peppy girl who introduced short clips acted out by puppets. The actress who played Yael was probably in her twenties, but she was dressed up to look like a child, in flowery dresses and pigtails. I loved that program, in which the puppets occasionally crossed into real life and made a mess of Yael\u2019s studio. Right before the opening music came on, Yael would look into the camera and fake-whisper to the viewers, \u201cTell your mother to turn up the volume!\u201d Once, as my twin sister and I were settling down on the sofa to watch, my mother overheard this opening bit. \u201cAnd what about those who don\u2019t have a mother?\u201d she asked.I must have been seven or eight at the time. I was irritated with her for asking that question, forever ruining the show for me. But I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised. It summed up, I now realize, her parenting philosophy. The way she didn\u2019t baby us, but treated us like thoughtful people, capable of empathy. The way she was always fully there\u2014registering, questioning. But mostly, I think, it showed her unyielding belief in fairness, which, years later, I would hear her define as justice played out in the private sphere. (She was a philosophy professor, preoccupied with definitions.) It was a particular kind of fairness, one that centered on a child\u2019s sensibility. Once, when I asked her whom she loved more, my sister or me, she answered, simply, \u201cYou.\u201d Incredulous, my sister posed the same question. \u201cWho do you love more, Ima? Ruth or me?\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d my mother said. We tried again. Each time, my mother invariably told whoever asked that she loved her more. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d we finally said. She smiled and told us, \u201cSure it does. Don\u2019t you see? I love you more and I love you more.\u201d This was her sense of fairness: no kid wants to hear that she is loved the same as her sister.This Mother\u2019s Day, three and a half years after she died, I find myself turning over her question in my mind. And what about those who don\u2019t have a mother?",

But one particular episode stands out in my memory, not for the show itself, but for the conversation that followed. The host, in a moment of levity, instructed his young viewers to \"Tell your mother to turn up the volume.\" My mother, a philosophy professor with a keen mind, posed a question that initially irritated me: \"And what about those who don't have a mother?\" At the time, I thought it was just another example of her being overly critical, but as I grew older, I began to appreciate the thoughtfulness behind her words. She wasn't trying to be difficult; she was teaching me to consider the perspectives of others, to think about those who might not have the same privileges as me.Years have passed since my mother's death, and as I reflect on my childhood, I realize just how unique her approach to parenting was. She treated my sister and me as capable, thoughtful people, worthy of empathy and understanding. Her sense of fairness was centered on our needs, rather than some abstract notion of equality. She knew that we were different, with different strengths and weaknesses, and she tailored her approach accordingly. And then there was the way she expressed love \u2013 a clever, playful way that still resonates with me today. Whenever we asked her who her favorite was, she would smile mischievously and tell each of us that she loved us \"more.\" It was a small thing, but it spoke volumes about her ability to connect with us on an individual level.

The host instructed his young audience to \"Tell your mother to turn up the volume.\" My mother, a philosophy professor, asked a question that initially irked me: \"And what about those who don't have a mother?\" At the time, I was just annoyed by her overthinking, but as I grew older, I began to see the value in her words. She was trying to make me see that the world was full of people who didn't have the same opportunities as I did. Years have passed since my mother's death, and I still find myself pondering the lessons she taught me. The way she loved me was a quiet, everyday love, shown through the way she'd make me my favorite breakfast or sit with me when I was sick. It was a love that didn't need to be spoken but was always there, a steady presence in my life. Now that she's gone, I can see that she was a truly unique parent, and I feel so lucky to have had her.",

The diverse pizza varieties, from the moiti\u00e9-moiti\u00e9 to Armenian and Corsican styles, serve as a culinary representation of the city's multicultural heritage shaped by successive waves of immigration from Italy, Armenia, Corsica, and North Africa.",
            "paragraph": "On a balmy night in Marseille, France\u2019s second-largest city, crowds move through the graffiti-toned streets of the central Cours Julien neighborhood. Buildings are splashed in color as if the nearby Mediterranean had washed up, ebbed out and left behind pigments of a shattered rainbow.It\u2019s almost midnight. The square is still buzzing with people cracking jokes and taking swigs of pastis. Restaurants are mostly closed, but a warm glow beckons from open counters, where the scent of tomato sauce, cheese and dough wafts through the air.\u201cHere, the late-night food isn\u2019t really kebabs or crepes,\u201d my Marseille-native friend Simon told me when I moved to the city just over a year ago. \u201cIt\u2019s pizza.\u201dMarseille pizza has a harder crust than the soft Neapolitan style. It\u2019s typically made with Emmental cheese instead of mozzarella. Some say this is simply because Emmental was traditionally more readily available; others swear it\u2019s saltier and richer. Pizza makers frequently swap Proven\u00e7al marjoram for oregano; sometimes they sprinkle raw garlic on top.The classic Marseille slice is the moiti\u00e9-moiti\u00e9 (half-half), a tomato-based pie with anchovies on one side and cheese on the other. The Armenian has minced beef, onions and peppers. Sweet figatelli sausage and brousse cheese, which is similar to ricotta, top the Corsican slice. Halal pizza is available in Noailles, a neighborhood near the port.That variety reflects the city itself. Italians first brought pizza to Marseille in the late 19th century, and since then, waves of immigrants, from places like Armenia, Corsica, and Algeria, have all embraced the dish and made it their own.\u201cIt\u2019s not very different from other big industrial port cities, but the difference in Marseille, a bit like New York maybe, is that there\u2019s a sort of narrative of cosmopolitanism,\u201d C\u00e9line Regnard, a local historian, said. \u201cThe city thinks of itself as a melting pot.\u201dMarseille is a mosaic of the people, culture and history that shape it. Pizza is a way to explore that mosaic.",

It was a place where folks knew their butcher\u2019s name. Kids played outside till dusk. You saw the same people every day.The neighborhood became a mecca for art and culture, championed by filmmaker and hometown hero Spike Lee, who set his first movies there. In the 1840s, Walt Whitman helped found Fort Greene Park, the neighborhood\u2019s beating heart, and almost a century later, Richard Wright wrote parts of Native Son in the 30-acre green space.\u201cIt was more family oriented, and you felt that family love.

Skyrocketing housing costs and stark economic disparity between longtime residents and newer, wealthier residents have forced lifelong Fort Greeners out of certain parts of the neighborhood, if not out entirely. Amid it all, one thing remains firm: an intrinsic sense of both camaraderie and mutual support.It\u2019s that sense of belonging that the Lay Out aims to protect. The idea was born in a group chat during 2020\u2019s Black Lives Matter marches\u2014Anadu and friends just wanted to create a safe space in the park, which is beloved to Fort Greeners. Anadu knows it so well, she can follow its pathways while reading a book. During the COVID-19 lockdowns, she picked up trash alongside maintenance crews on her daily walks.",

The author contends that literature, particularly novels, can help improve emotional intelligence and form identities, advocating for a more inclusive literary culture that encourages young men to read and write without diminishing progress for women writers.",
            "paragraph": "In recent decades, young men have regressed educationally, emotionally and culturally. Among women matriculating at four-year public colleges, about half will graduate four years later; for men the rate is under 40 percent. This disparity surely translates to a drop-off in the number of novels young men read, as they descend deeper into video games and pornography. Young men who still exhibit curiosity about the world too often seek intellectual stimulation through figures of the \u201cmanosphere\u201d such as Andrew Tate and Joe Rogan.The marginalization of young men seems to have been a significant factor in this year\u2019s presidential election. No voters were more committed to Mr. Trump than young white men \u2014 and he also did well with Hispanic men and continued to make gains with Black men. I think of 2024 as the \u201cFight Club\u201d election, in which disaffected guys vented their frustrations and anxieties through a brawler who will one day reveal himself to be not their hero, but rather a figment of their imagination.These young men need better stories \u2014 and they need to see themselves as belonging to the world of storytelling. Novels do many things. They entertain, inspire, puzzle, hypnotize. But reading fiction is also an excellent way to improve one\u2019s emotional I.Q. Novels help us form our identities and understand our lives. Like many other bookish Gen X-ers, I can\u2019t conceive of my formative years without the Douglas Coupland novel that gave our generation its name. This is why we need a more inclusive literary culture, one that will bring young men in from the cold.I am not saying that we should declare progress for women writers complete and now focus only on men. The question for me is: What will become of literature \u2014 and indeed, of society \u2014 if men are no longer involved in reading and writing? The fortunes of men and women are intertwined. This is why, for example, I make sure that my male students read \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d It\u2019s not just their edification that matters; women also benefit from the existence of better men.",

But as I reflect on this phenomenon, I'm convinced that one key to reversing this trend lies in literature.

My apartment, once a modest space, morphed into a pasta laboratory, filled with the aromas of simmering sauces and the soft glow of Italian cookbooks. I became fixated on the art of crafting the perfect spaghetti dish, alone. The solitude was intentional, a necessary condition for my obsessive experimentation. I scoured markets for exotic ingredients, amassed specialized equipment, and spent hours perfecting my technique. Friends and family grew concerned, but I couldn't be swayed. The sizzle of garlic, the gentle twirl of a fork, and the satisfying bite of al dente noodles became my sole preoccupations. My kitchen transformed into a shrine, where I'd lose myself in the pursuit of gastronomic nirvana. In retrospect, it was an all-consuming passion, one that bordered on madness. Yet, even now, I can almost smell the slow-cooked rag\u00f9, and my heart skips a beat.

The sizzle of garlic, the aroma of olive oil, and the texture of al dente pasta became my only concerns. My friends and family grew worried, but I couldn't tear myself away. In the end, I produced a single, sublime plate of spaghetti, which I devoured in a moment of pure, unadulterated joy. This may have been a frivolous pursuit, but the memory of it still brings a smile to my face and a rumble to my stomach.",

It began innocently enough\u2014a newfound appreciation for Italian cuisine, a casual dinner party that turned into a weekly ritual. Before I knew it, as if I'd stumbled into a culinary heaven and was never able to leave, my apartment had become a bustling kitchen, the aroma of simmering sauces mingling with the soft glow of Italian cookbooks. I scoured the markets for the most obscure ingredients. I spent my days perfecting my technique and my evenings trying out new recipes. My friends and family grew concerned, but I couldn't be swayed. The sizzle of garlic, the twirl of a fork, the bite of a well-cooked noodle\u2014these were my only concerns. My kitchen became my sanctuary, the place where I could lose myself in the simple act of cooking. The year of pasta may be over, but I can still taste the sauces, still smell the aroma of the kitchen. It was a fleeting indulgence, but one that continues to shape my life.",
