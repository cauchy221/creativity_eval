Each rehearsal was a blend of individual discipline and collective harmony, a silent negotiation among the musicians. She had a special rapport with the principal cellist, Daniel, that went beyond the music they shared. Their glances across the rehearsal room were fleeting but loaded with meaning, a silent conversation that only they could decipher. During one late-night session, when the others had packed up and left, Daniel lingered. They didn't speak much; they didn't need to. He handed her his cello, a gesture of trust as she let her fingers travel across the strings. The resonance of the instrument under her touch was a language of its own, melding vulnerability with an unspoken promise. In those moments, their connection was as clear and as hauntingly beautiful as the music they created together. Their relationship transcended the personal shadows that often plagued the heart, becoming a private duet no audience could ever interpret.",

The gossip—because she was not one of them, both the men and the women trusted her with indiscretions that they wouldn’t risk with one another. And when he had differences with guest conductors from Bulgaria or Japan or God knows where, their egos as complex as the pronunciation of their names, his exasperation found relief, as he unburdened himself in bed of the podium dramas and moved on to the haven of lovemaking. If she was in a low mood—the -bungles of an inefficient colleague at work, or her father’s “heart condition” and her mother’s long complaints over the telephone about his disobeying doctor’s orders with his whiskey-swilling golfers—the cello would join them in the bedroom and he’d play for her. Sometimes until she fell asleep to the low tender tones of what had become his voice, to her, the voice of that big curved instrument, its softly buffed surface and graceful bulk held close against his body, sharing the intimacy that was hers. At concerts, when his solo part came, she did not realize that she was smiling in recognition, that this was a voice she would have recognized anywhere, among other cellists bowing other instruments.",

It had a cone shape and was concentrated precisely in this point. There was nothing left in the whole world besides the pain. Then suddenly a tiny shining dot appeared; it seemed to move, spinning slightly and drawing him to itself. The walls of the black cone grew still more black, and it became apparent that they were moving, as if this bright dot made them turn, pulling them into itself. He sensed the pull of this movement. The dot expanded, a sharp ray of light burst from it, and he headed toward it. The pain was with him, but it was also spinning and had ceased to be so tormenting. In this expanding dot the note “la” emerged, and he adjusted himself to it and moved in the direction of the light. The corridor of the darkness spun, pressing him, but also expanded slightly, as if becoming larger, and his movement toward the bright dot was becoming ever more perceptible. He was being pulled there against his will, but his will was also directed there.",

As I made my way to the bar, I caught snippets of conversations: a debate about the merits of Cork versus Kerry football, a whispered tale of a lost love, and a raucous rendition of \"The Wild Rover\" sung by a group of rowdy locals. The atmosphere was equal parts convivial and chaotic, like a warm hug from an old friend. I felt a pang of nostalgia, remembering the countless nights I'd spent in pubs just like this one, listening to my grandfather's stories of the old country.

Near the fireplace, an elderly couple sat hand in hand, their eyes closed, letting the music wash over them. As I made my way to the bar, I caught snippets of conversations: a debate about the merits of Cork versus Kerry football, a whispered tale of what sounded like lost love, and a raucous rendition of \"The Wild Rover\" sung by a group of rowdy locals. I felt a pang of nostalgia, remembering the countless nights I'd spent in pubs just like this one, listening to my grandfather's stories of the old country. I raised my own pint to my lips and I felt his presence there next to me.",

Newspapers were folded over and the Deaths column squinted at with sour interest. He knew that his father spoke to God in the night. Once he had heard his father whisper so in the night. His father told God that he was very proud of him and of all his godly works.

He was the prince of the room and invulnerable.",

She was celebrating her best friend Rachel's birthday, surrounded by their tight-knit group of friends, and the atmosphere was lively and carefree. But as the night wore on, Emma's laughter began to take on a slightly manic edge, and her words started to spill out in a jumbled, confessional manner. She began to talk about her recent breakup, about the ways in which she felt lost and uncertain, about the lingering sense of inadequacy that had been plaguing her for months. Rachel listened intently, her eyes filled with concern, as Emma's words tumbled out in a messy, emotional cascade. But then, in a moment of reckless abandon, Emma blurted out a comment about Rachel's own relationship, a thoughtless remark that was meant to be a joke but landed with a thud. The room fell silent, and Rachel's face went pale. Emma's eyes widened in horror as she realized what she had said, the words hanging in the air like a challenge. The rest of the night was a blur, but Emma remembered the look on Rachel's face, the hurt and betrayal etched across her features like a scar. In the days that followed, Emma would replay the moment over and over, wondering how she could have been so careless, so cruel. She knew that apologies would be necessary, but she also knew that some wounds ran too deep to be easily healed.",

All people were ordered below but many of them crumpled up against the rail and did not care if they were washed over. None of our family was sick however and now the wind has dropped and the sun has come out and those who did not care if they died in the filth a little while ago have got up and dragged themselves to be washed where the sailors are splashing buckets of water over the decks.

She smoked it, or, rather, took tinctures of THC on her tongue. But the idea that I might be out of the house doing anything enjoyable, and not generating revenue, enraged her. She had a right to be enraged. She was home with our son a good deal. It took a toll. You can cobble together a solid twelve minutes of unconquerable joy a day caring for a toddler. It’s just the other fourteen or fifteen hours that strip your nerves and immolate your spirit. Peg was a warrior, but she got testy when I told her that. She said she didn’t want to be a warrior. She wanted to be the smart, sexy, sociable woman she’d been before Philip.",

Blood was taken from her earlobe to test how fit she was. There were pink pills and blue pills. Vitamins, she was told. Later, there were injections—just more vitamins.

Something compelled Colbert Prentiss to depart from his text near the end of his sermon that morning. It might have been all the grandparents he saw before him, all the people who had struggled into old age only to find themselves parents once again. Clement Carson. Mr. and Mrs. Harrelson. The widow Anderson. Colbert’s own sister and brother-in-law. Mr. and Mrs. Apacka. Maggie and Noah Robinson. All of them the kind of people the preacher had built his rock on. The world was turned upside down when the mature ones were forced to do what the younger ones should be doing. Indeed, it was August, so why not have it snow outside, Colbert said to the hundreds. Why not lift our eyes to the sky and see all the pigs flying with their cherub wings?",

As she wandered the aisles, her thoughts often drifted to her daughters, Emily and Rachel, and the countless times they'd accompanied her on these weekly trips.

Now, as she navigated the crowded store alone, Evelyn's mind turned to the advice she'd impart to her girls when they'd call her later that day. She'd think about the importance of buying whole grains, of not sacrificing quality for convenience, and of the value of a well-stocked pantry. Her thoughts were a mix of practicality and nostalgia, as she remembered the countless meals she'd prepared for her family over the years. As she selected a bunch of fresh parsley, Evelyn's mind wandered to Emily's latest cooking experiment, and she made a mental note to ask about it when they spoke. At the checkout line, she'd exchange pleasantries with the cashier, a woman around her age, and wonder about her own story, her own daughters.

She watches the women who roam the aisles gripping baskets barely weighted with a single chicken breast, two oranges, a child-sized carton of milk meant for lunchboxes. Walking advertisements for precarity. Who wants to die alone in her apartment and be left undiscovered for enough time that the smell of soured milk would be the giveaway? And here was another piece of advice her daughters had ignored: Always wear a good pair of underwear and a matching bra. Which was the opposite kind of warning, she realizes, aimed not at longevity but at the possibility of dying suddenly and violently and being discovered with your skirt up around your ears in a pair of sad panties.",

As he filled the kettle, his hands trembled almost imperceptibly. Wendy felt a pang in her chest, realizing how much time had passed since she'd last been home. The kitchen itself seemed smaller, the once-cheery yellow walls now faded and peeling in places. Her father hummed softly, a tune she didn't recognize, as he spooned instant coffee into his mug.

There was something both comforting and melancholy about watching him go through this routine, a glimpse into his solitary life that she rarely considered.

Sometimes when she’d been working in the garden her usual stiffness unwound. “He’s growing garrulous in his old age. Child-friendly. Religious. What a turnup.”",

The small-town pain specialist had always been known for his compassionate approach, but as opioid addiction rates climbed in the community, suspicions grew. A state medical board investigation revealed irregularities in his prescribing patterns, with an unusually high number of patients receiving powerful painkillers for extended periods. Despite Steiger's insistence that he was merely addressing chronic pain issues often overlooked by other doctors, the board ordered him to cease prescribing opioids pending further review. Steiger, a man in his late fifties with graying hair and tired eyes, found himself caught between his Hippocratic oath and a system increasingly wary of potential abuse. He maintained his innocence, arguing that the complexities of pain management were being oversimplified by bureaucrats who had never sat across from a patient in agony. As his practice dwindled and former patients sought care elsewhere, Steiger retreated into his modest home on the outskirts of town, poring over medical journals and patient files, determined to prove that his methods, while unorthodox, were rooted in genuine care for his patients' well-being. The once-respected doctor now walked a fine line between vindication and disgrace, his fate hanging in the balance of a medical system grappling with its own role in a growing crisis.",

A state medical board investigation revealed irregularities in his prescribing patterns: Dr. Steiger maintained an unusually high number of patients receiving powerful painkillers for extended periods. Despite his insistence that he was merely addressing the profound chronic pain issues overlooked by other doctors, the medical board ordered him to cease prescribing opioids pending further review. Steiger, a man in his late fifties with graying hair and tired eyes, found himself caught between his Hippocratic oath and a system increasingly wary of potential abuse. He maintained his innocence, arguing that the complexities of pain management were being oversimplified by bureaucrats who had never sat across from a patient in agony. As his practice dwindled and former patients sought care elsewhere, Steiger retreated into his modest home on the outskirts of town, poring over medical journals and patient files, determined to prove that his methods, while unorthodox, were rooted in genuine care for his patients' well-being. The more patients who left, however, the more he doubted whether he had been caring for them or whether they had been looking for a fix. He didn't know. He felt as if he were walking a fine line between vindication and disgrace, even in his own mind.",

        "Human-Written": "One of Dr. R. K. Smile’s favorite doctors, Dr. Arthur Steiger, an experienced pain specialist from Cormac, Arizona, was ordered to stop prescribing painkillers completely while serious allegations against him were investigated. At that time, he had received more speaker’s fees from SPEIK than any other medical practitioner, even though, unfortunately, all the much-anticipated events at which he had been billed to speak had had to be cancelled owing to unforeseeable factors. Dr. Steiger fought back when he was indicted. “There is a vendetta against doctors who prescribe opioids regularly,” he said. “But me, I’m the aggressive type. I aggressively help my patients. I’m the caring type also. I care aggressively. That’s just who I am.”",

For she was now executing the perfect back flip that she’d never been able to pull off on a high dive. The air rushed in her ears like water. This time the feeling was different—that is, the starkness was there, the calmness was there also, but these clean, serene sensations were spiked with a sharp surprise, which quickly morphed to perplexity, and then to sorrow. She fit in a wisp of disappointment before the fall was through. Her eyes tearing, the lights of high-rises blurred. Above, the evening sky rippled into the infinite ocean that had waited to greet her for fourteen years: largely good years, really—gravy, a long and lucky reprieve. Then, of course, what had mattered was her body striking the line, and now what mattered was not striking it—and what were the chances of that? By the time she reached the sidewalk, Liana had taken back her surprise. At some point there was no almost. That had always been the message. There were bystanders, and they would get the message, too. ♦",

        "preedit": "In the dim light of her dressing room, Grady sits before a three-way mirror, her fingers tracing the edge of a lipstick tube. Through the reflection, she observes Clyde pacing behind her, his agitation evident in the way he keeps adjusting his tie. Neither speaks, but the air is thick with unspoken words. Grady's eyes flick between Clyde's reflection and her own, noting how the angles of the mirror fragment his image, much like the fractures in their relationship. She applies her lipstick with practiced precision, using the routine to maintain her composure. Clyde's reflection grows larger as he approaches, then shrinks as he retreats, a visual representation of their push-and-pull dynamic. A discarded script lies on the vanity, its pages ruffled by the oscillating fan, serving as a reminder of the performance they're both about to give – on stage and off. Grady's hand pauses mid-application as Clyde's reflection finally stills. Their eyes meet in the mirror, a moment of silent communication that speaks volumes. She caps the lipstick with a soft click, the sound echoing in the loaded silence.",

        "Human-Written": "In her dressing room there was a table with a three-way mirror. Grady, unclasping a bracelet chain, could see in the mirror every movement of Clyde’s in the other room. He undressed quickly, leaving his clothes wherever he happened to be; down to his shorts, he lighted a cigarette and stretched himself, the colors of sun reﬂecting along his body. Then, smiling toward her, he dropped his shorts and stood in the doorway: “You mean that? That I disgust you?” She shook her head slowly; and he said, “You bet you don’t,” while the mirror, jarred by the fall of her chair, shot through the dusk arrows of dazzle. ♦",
