Few-shot Examples:


Example 1:
Input Text:
In the dim seclusion of my cluttered attic studio, dust motes dancing in a beam of afternoon light, I was not expecting a visit from a genie. Yet there he stood, incongruously calm amidst the chaos; a robed figure materializing from a lamp rummaged from an old box. He offered a choice, unblinking: a Picasso to possess or to become Picasso himself. My eyes darted to my unfinished canvases, the palpable struggle of creation hanging heavy. Owning a Picasso would grant instant acclaim, financial security, no more scraping by on sporadic commissions. But would it hollow me out to know that my worth hinged on someone else's genius? To become Picasso, though, would mean losing meâ€”the very me shaping these imperfect, yet deeply mine, works. The genius would be there, but the struggle, the growth, the small victories would be gone. I gazed at the genie, and in the narrow silence, I realized the true essence of creation lies not in just a finished masterpiece, but in the person wrought from the art's process.

Example 2:
Input Text:
Maria's evenings with the orchestra were intricate studies in unspoken relationships. Each rehearsal was a blend of individual discipline and collective harmony, a silent negotiation among the musicians. She had a special rapport with the principal cellist, Daniel, that went beyond the music they shared. Their glances across the rehearsal room were fleeting but loaded with meaning, a silent conversation that only they could decipher. During one late-night session, when the others had packed up and left, Daniel lingered. They didn't speak much; they didn't need to. He handed her his cello, a gesture of trust as she let her fingers travel across the strings. The resonance of the instrument under her touch was a language of its own, melding vulnerability with an unspoken promise. In those moments, their connection was as clear and as hauntingly beautiful as the music they created together. Their relationship transcended the personal shadows that often plagued the heart, becoming a private duet no audience could ever interpret.

Example 3:
Input Text:
Elena stared blankly at the award ceremony playing on her television, her fingers limp around the remote. Each name called and each blinding smile churned something cold and heavy in her chest. The room felt smaller, the air thicker, as if the walls were inching closer to trap her in this moment of cruel clarity. She had worked harder than anyone she knew, yet here she was, seated in a thrift store armchair with fabric rough enough to scratch skin. Her best efforts seemed like tiny, smudged stickers beside the shining medals others carried with ease. She could almost hear a distant ticking, the sound of time slipping away silently, carrying her chances with it. Her friends' voices echoed in her mind, always urging patience and perseverance, but they felt like ghostly whispers in an empty, mocking room. The world outside her small apartment seemed to throb with opportunities she couldn't touch. Her breath hitched, not in sorrow, but in a quiet, persistent resignation. Life moved on, often leaving her stranded on the shore, watching the waves that never reached her feet.

Input Text:
In the bustling streets of Taipei, the aroma of Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken wafts from street vendors and night markets, tantalizing passersby with its crispy, savory allure. To recreate this beloved snack at home, start by marinating bite-sized chicken pieces in a mixture of soy sauce, sugar, garlic, and five-spice powder. The key to achieving the signature "popcorn" texture lies in the double-frying process: first, blanch the chicken in hot oil to cook it through, then chill it before re-frying until golden and puffed. Meanwhile, prepare the fried basil by coating fresh leaves in a light batter of flour, cornstarch, and ice-cold soda water, then frying them until crispy and fragrant. To add depth to the dish, Taiwanese cooks often employ a trio of peppercorns: Szechuan peppercorns, with their unique numbing quality, add a subtle tingling sensation; white peppercorns provide a sharp, clean heat; and black peppercorns contribute a rich, earthy undertone. Grind the peppercorns coarsely and sprinkle them over the chicken and basil, allowing the flavors to meld together. As you take your first bite, the combination of textures and flavors will transport you to the vibrant streets of Taiwan, where the humble snack is elevated to an art form.

Example 5:
Input Text:
Mariama Ekwensi moved to the small coastal town after years of drifting through shaded cities and sun-soaked villages. Her skin held stories in its scars, her eyes a flicker of ancient wisdom. Mariama's life twisted into unexpected roles, the most recent being a caretaker for a cluster of children who filled her otherwise quiet days with laughter and chaos. She found herself particularly drawn to Philip Walker, a boy whose silence was his loudest cry. With eyes like slate, Philip watched her as if she were a new moon he was still trying to understand. Mariama's gentle persistence slowly chipped away at his guarded exterior, not through grand gestures but in the simple, consistent ways she let him know he was seen. On windy afternoons, she would make kites out of old newspapers and teach him to fly them, his grip tightening on the string as though each flight tethered him a bit more securely to her world. As months rolled by, the lines of her responsibility blurred into genuine care, for in nurturing Philip, she was also stitching the frayed edges of her own wandering spirit.
